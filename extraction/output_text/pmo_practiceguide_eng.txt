Preface
The Project Management Institute has created Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide with an 
ambitious vision: to reshape PMOs worldwide.
This comprehensive guide transcends traditional good practices, offering a forward-looking 
roadmap distilled from the collective wisdom of hundreds of seasoned PMO professionals 
across the globe. These experts, ranging from leaders of world-class PMOs in renowned 
organizations to esteemed consultants, bring diverse backgrounds and extensive experience 
in establishing, operating, and evolving PMOs. We extend our heartfelt thanks to all of these 
volunteers who generously contributed their time, expertise, and insights to the development 
and review of this guide. Their dedication and commitment have been invaluable in shaping this 
comprehensive resource.
The genesis of this guide dates back to the early 2010s, culminating in significant milestones such 
as the founding of the PMO Global Alliance (PMOGA) and the release of the PMO Value Ring™ 
methodology in 2017. PMOGA’s rapid growth led to its acquisition by the Project Management 
Institute (PMI) in late 2023, solidifying its position as the world’s largest and most respected 
PMO community.
As the PMI global PMO community, PMOGA continued to refine and expand the methodology 
through extensive feedback and innovative ideas from its members. This iterative process resulted 
in the new PMO Value Ring™ framework, which forms the core of this practice guide. It combines 
an innovative, customer-centric approach with an unwavering focus on value generation, enabling 
PMO professionals to tailor their approaches to specific organizational contexts.
The development of this guide began with a comprehensive literature review, encompassing 
diverse academic research and expert-authored books. This exploration identified key themes, 
challenges, and gaps in current PMO knowledge, providing a solid theoretical foundation and 
inspiring new concepts to address these areas. What sets this guide apart, however, is its deep 
roots in practical experience. Through numerous discussions, surveys, interviews, case studies, 
and collaborative sessions with seasoned professionals worldwide, we have gathered insights that 
reflect the true complexity and diversity of PMO practices.
This blend of theory and practice has resulted in a guide that is both comprehensive and 
immediately applicable. It challenges conventional thinking while offering tested solutions to 
common PMO challenges, contributing fresh, innovative insights to the field of PMO management.

Introduction  3
extensive compilation of books and academic articles related to the topics discussed in this guide, 
providing additional resources for deeper study and understanding of certain aspects that are 
presented more concisely in the following sections.
To complement this foundation, hundreds of experienced PMO professionals participated in surveys 
and interviews, including PMO leaders, consultants, team members, and executives across the 
globe. Bringing together their multiple perspectives on current practices, challenges, and future 
trends, the guide addresses the most pressing concerns of today’s PMO professionals.
An expert panel of thought leaders from project management and adjacent fields engaged 
in insightful debates and discussions, challenging assumptions and refining concepts to 
incorporate perspectives from areas that are traditionally outside of project management, such 
as customer experience, which is central to the framework proposed in this guide. Exploring the 
intersection of these diverse fields through collaborative discussions helped to develop a holistic 
approach that rethinks the PMO’s role in driving organizational success while ensuring that these 
recommendations are both innovative and grounded in real-world applicability.
To further strengthen the guide’s foundation, an in-depth analysis was conducted of dozens of 
PMOs that excelled in recent annual PMO Global Awards—the largest and most prestigious awards 
program recognizing PMO excellence worldwide, originally created by the PMO Global Alliance 
and now part of the Project Management Institute. By examining these high-performing PMOs 
alongside those facing significant challenges, the guide distills key lessons and practices that form 
the core of this area, capturing emerging trends and future directions.
Dozens of workshops with PMO professionals were conducted over a period of 6 years to test, 
validate, and refine the ideas that form the frameworks presented in this guide. This hands-on 
approach ensures that recommendations are not only theoretically sound but also practically 
implementable. In fact, many aspects of the framework have been utilized by PMOs around the 
world long before the publication of this guide.
Finally, this guide was reviewed by an extensive group of experienced PMO professionals from 
various countries and industries. This process allowed thousands of professionals from the global 
project management community to provide valuable feedback.
By employing this multifaceted methodology, Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide, a 
resource deeply rooted in practical experience and collaborative engagement, has been developed. 
This guide is much more than just a compilation of existing knowledge; it is a trusted, up-to-
date, and future-oriented resource that provides PMO professionals at all levels with insights and 
strategies that can be immediately applied to enhance PMO performance and drive organizational 
success.
The Innovative Edge of This Guide
Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide represents a significant leap forward in PMO 
management practices, offering a fresh, innovative approach that sets it apart from traditional 
approaches. Its relevance and unique contributions make it an indispensable tool for PMO 
professionals navigating the complexities of modern organizational environments.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
Firstly, this guide introduces a paradigm shift in how PMOs are conceptualized and operated. 
Moving beyond the traditional view of PMOs as mere administrative entities, it presents a dynamic, 
value-driven model that positions PMOs as strategic partners in organizational success. This shift 
is crucial in today’s fast-paced business environment, where PMOs must continually demonstrate 
their value and adaptability.
A key innovation of this guide is its customer-centric approach to PMO management. Unlike many 
existing resources that focus primarily on functions, services, processes, and methodologies, 
this guide emphasizes understanding and meeting the needs of PMO customers within the 
organization. It provides frameworks for identifying customer needs, tailoring PMO services, and 
measuring customer satisfaction, enabling PMOs to become more responsive and valuable to 
their organizations.
The guide introduces a sophisticated maturity model specifically designed for PMO services. This 
model goes beyond simple, stage-based progressions, offering a multidimensional framework that 
allows PMOs to assess and develop their capabilities across various services. This nuanced approach 
to maturity enables PMOs to evolve in a more targeted and effective manner.
Another unique aspect is the guide’s integration of agile principles into PMO operations. While 
many resources treat traditional and agile approaches as mutually exclusive, this guide offers 
an innovative approach for creating an agility-driven PMO that can support both predictive 
and adaptive project environments. This flexibility is crucial for PMOs operating in diverse 
organizational contexts.
The guide also breaks new ground in its approach to measuring and communicating PMO value. 
It introduces the concept of “perception of value” for PMOs—advanced metrics and valuation 
techniques that go beyond traditional project success measures—helping PMOs articulate their 
contributions to strategic organizational goals. This is particularly relevant in an era where PMOs 
are increasingly expected to justify their existence and demonstrate tangible business impact, 
becoming a strategic investment for the future and not just a “cost center.”
The guide stands out in its visionary perspective. It not only addresses current challenges but also 
prepares PMO professionals for emerging trends and future scenarios. It provides strategies for 
creating flexible PMO structures that can quickly pivot in response to changing organizational needs 
or external pressures. This adaptability is crucial in today’s volatile business environment.
Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide is highly relevant to today’s PMO professionals 
because it addresses the evolving challenges they face while providing innovative solutions and 
forward-looking strategies. By embracing the concepts and strategies presented in this guide, PMO 
professionals can transform their PMOs into dynamic, value-driven entities that are indispensable to 
their organizations’ success.

Understanding the PMO
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
For PMO professionals, a deep understanding of the PMO’s nature, evolution, and diversity is not 
just academic knowledge—it is a critical foundation for success. This section is essential because it 
provides the context necessary to navigate the complex and ever-changing landscape of PMOs in 
modern organizations.
Firstly, this section provides a historical context that helps to appreciate how PMOs have 
transformed from their inception to their current form. This knowledge allows PMO professionals to 
better understand the core functions and roles that PMOs have played over the decades and how 
these have been influenced by changing business needs and technological advancements.
Secondly, recognizing the diverse paths of PMO development highlights the importance of 
adaptability and customization. By studying these variations, PMO professionals can gain insights 
into how PMOs can be tailored to meet specific organizational requirements and cultural contexts.
Lastly, this section provides a rich repository of ideas and practices that professionals can draw 
from. It highlights the benefits and limitations of various approaches and encourages a more 
flexible, hybrid approach tailored to the specific needs of the organization. This flexibility is key to 
maintaining relevance and effectiveness in rapidly changing business environments.
Defining the PMO
In recent years, the PMO has become a significant aspect of leading organizations across the 
globe. As businesses face increasingly complex challenges and a rapidly changing global 
economic environment, PMOs have emerged as crucial for ensuring project success and driving 
organizational strategy.
For at least four decades, PMOs have been defined as management entities that standardize the 
project-related governance processes and facilitate the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, 
and techniques to maximize the return on project investments.1 However, the role of PMOs has

evolved far beyond this basic definition. Modern PMOs are increasingly becoming dynamic and 
adaptable entities that are crucial in aligning project outcomes with organizational objectives, 
fostering innovation, and driving business value.
The significance of PMOs in today’s business environment is immense. As organizations increasingly 
rely on projects to implement strategy and drive change, PMOs serve as the crucial link between 
executive vision and operational execution. They can operate at strategic, tactical, or operational 
levels, becoming invaluable partners to their customers and empowering leaders to achieve success.
However, it is important to note that PMOs are not one-size-fits-all entities. Their structure, function, 
and focus vary significantly based on organizational needs, industry context, and maturity levels. 
In the vast landscape of project management literature, the PMO emerges as a concept with 
myriad interpretations. While consensus exists on its fundamental nature—a centralized team or 
department within an organization—the specifics of its functions and scope vary widely.
A common confusion occurs when people refer to the PMO leader as “the PMO,” which is 
conceptually incorrect unless they are referring to a “project management officer,” a title that is not 
commonly used for professionals leading PMOs. Typically, these leaders are referred to as managers, 
coordinators, or directors, depending on the PMO’s characteristics. Referring to the PMO as a single 
individual minimizes the significant impact it has on organizational performance. The PMO as an 
entity ensures that projects are managed effectively and aligned with business objectives, while the 
PMO leader is just one part of this larger system. It is crucial to differentiate between the PMO as an 
organizational entity and the PMO leader as the individual who manages and leads its functions.
Some definitions emphasize the PMO’s role in standardizing processes and methods, while others 
highlight its function in supporting projects and project managers. More strategic interpretations 
position the PMO as a key player in portfolio management. Occasionally, though less commonly, the 
PMO is described as the central hub for project management despite project managers often being 
dispersed across various business units.
Amid this diversity of perspectives, one common thread persists: The PMO is invariably a formal 
organizational entity dedicated to managing portfolios, programs, and projects. However, its precise 
purpose, scope, and responsibilities can differ significantly from one organization to another.
Rather than attempting to craft an all-encompassing definition, it is more pragmatic to 
acknowledge this inherent diversity. Thus, we propose a simple yet flexible PMO definition:
PMOs are organizational entities, typically established as departments or teams, primarily tasked with 
centralizing activities related to the management of portfolios, programs, and/or projects. The nature of 
these activities can vary according to the unique needs of each organization. 
While not always called project management offices, some organizational units serve the same 
purpose under different names. These entities align with the core PMO definition by performing 
common PMO functions and sharing similar objectives.

Understanding the PMO  17
To illustrate the multifaceted nature of PMOs, consider a cube with each of its six sides presenting 
one component of a concept. When combined, the six concepts form a fuller picture of the cube 
and what it represents. If there are six people, each one looking at only one side of the cube, they 
will each have a limited perception of what the full cube represents. But when combining their 
knowledge, they gain a better picture of the cube as a whole (see Figure 3-1).
This example serves as an apt metaphor for understanding PMOs. As each individual’s perception 
of the cube is correct yet incomplete, so are the various perspectives on PMOs. Each viewpoint 
captures a valid aspect of what a PMO can be, but none encapsulates its full potential.
PMO professionals, like those viewing only one side of the cube, often focus on specific aspects of 
PMO functionality based on their experiences and areas of expertise. Some may emphasize process

standardization, others project support, and others strategic alignment. While each perspective is 
valid, it represents only a part of the PMO’s potential scope.
Organizations are not static entities. They move, evolve, grow, and face new challenges. A PMO that 
remains rigidly focused on one aspect of its potential functionality risks becoming less effective 
over time.
For instance, a PMO initially established to enforce project management standards may need 
to pivot toward portfolio management and strategic alignment as the organization matures. 
Recognizing and adapting to these changing needs is paramount for PMO success.
The example of the cube underscores the importance of recognizing and integrating diverse 
perspectives in understanding PMOs. It highlights that PMOs can and should be different, adapting 
to their organization’s specific needs and contexts.
PMO professionals should remain aware that their current perspective, while valuable, is part of a 
larger, dynamic whole. As the organizational context shifts, so must the PMO’s approach, ensuring it 
continues delivering value and supporting strategic objectives effectively.
In essence, the key to PMO success lies in embracing this diversity and maintaining the flexibility to 
adapt. By doing so, PMOs can remain relevant, effective, and valuable assets in the ever-changing 
landscape of modern organizations.
This guide explores the multifaceted nature of PMOs; their evolving role in modern organizations; 
and good practices for establishing, operating, and improving effective PMOs. By understanding 
the critical role of PMOs in today’s business context, PMO professionals can better position 
themselves to drive organizational success and navigate the complexities of modern project 
management.
Understanding PMO Challenges
The evolving landscape of project management presents numerous challenges for PMOs in today’s 
organizations. These challenges are diverse and complex, ranging from strategic alignment issues to 
technological disruptions, and addressing them is crucial for PMOs to remain relevant and valuable 
in the modern business environment.
One of the primary challenges that PMOs face is demonstrating tangible value to the organization. 
In an era of lean operations and budget scrutiny, PMOs are under increasing pressure to justify their 
existence by showing how they contribute to the bottom line. This challenge is compounded by 
the difficulty in quantifying the often-intangible benefits of effective project management, such as 
improved decision-making and risk mitigation.
Another significant challenge is adapting to the rapid pace of technological change. As new 
technologies emerge, such as artificial intelligence (AI), PMOs should continuously evolve to 
incorporate these innovations while ensuring consistency across the organization. This balancing 
act between innovation and stability is a constant struggle for many PMOs.

Understanding the PMO  19
Strategic alignment also remains a persistent challenge. PMOs should ensure that programs 
and projects are executed efficiently and contribute meaningfully to organizational goals. This 
effort requires a deep understanding of business strategy and translating it into actionable 
project portfolios.
A 2023 research-based thought leadership report from the Project Management Institute suggested 
that PMOs with increasingly strategic roles can generate more value for their organizations.2 
However, securing a seat on the executive board and gaining the trust of senior management 
remains a significant challenge for many PMOs, which are still often viewed by executives as tactical 
and operational areas rather than strategic assets.
This challenge persists not only because PMOs may need to position themselves adequately 
within their organizations but also because, in many cases, low organizational maturity in project 
management prevents executives from fully recognizing the potential value offered by the 
PMO. This lack of value recognition creates a complex dynamic where PMOs struggle to elevate 
their status and influence within the organization despite their potential to drive significant 
strategic value.
PMOs face the dual challenge of demonstrating their strategic value while simultaneously educating 
and influencing organizational leaders about the broader impact of effective project management. 
This effort requires PMOs to develop sophisticated communication strategies that can articulate 
their value proposition in terms that resonate with executive leadership, often translating project 
management outcomes into business impacts and strategic advantages.
Moreover, PMOs should navigate the delicate balance of providing immediate, tangible 
benefits while also working toward long-term strategic alignment and organizational maturity. 
Obtaining this balance often involves a gradual process of building credibility through consistent 
value delivery, coupled with ongoing efforts to raise awareness about project management’s 
strategic potential.
Decoding the PMO: From Origins to Modern Adaptability
The PMO has a rich history of continuous evolution, reflecting the ever-changing needs of 
businesses and the increasing significance of project management. Over time, these organizational 
units have evolved from merely providing technical support to becoming key strategic players in 
today’s business environment.
It should be noted that the evolution of PMOs globally has not followed a uniform path. Their 
development has differed significantly across different regions and industries due to influences such 
as local organizational cultures and maturity levels. Whereas some areas now boast widespread 
PMO sophistication in their business landscape, others are still at the early stages of this journey, 
with much room for growth and refinement in their PMO practices.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
Here is a detailed look at the key stages in the development of PMOs over the decades (see Figure 3-2):
•	 Early Foundations (1950s to 1970s). What we recognize today as PMOs can be traced back to 
the mid-20th century. To implement large-scale government and military projects, centralized 
project management functions were established during the 1950s and 1960s. For instance, the 
U.S. Department of Defense set up PMOs to manage complex defense projects during the Cold 
War era, and this approach is still successfully used today. Similarly, NASA used a centralized 
approach for managing projects in coordination with the Apollo space mission, which was 
considered an ambitious undertaking during the 1960s. These early versions of PMOs were 
geared toward managing large-scale, elaborate projects that called for detailed coordination 
as well as oversight. Their role was mostly about processes—mainly schedule control, resource 
allocation, and cost control.
•	 The Control Era (1980s). PMOs began appearing in corporate settings through operational 
perspectives focused on control and auditing around the 1980s. During this period, PMOs acted 
like watchdogs that ensured adherence to predetermined schedules, budgets, or specifications 
within any given project context. Performing in this capacity meant maintaining tight control 
over execution, often through stringent reporting processes coupled with robust monitoring 
systems. Though it kept projects disciplined, this control-centric approach sometimes made 
PMOs appear bureaucratic, hence stalling progress in those projects. However, this approach laid 
the foundation for future sophistication of project management practices.
•	 The Methodology Boom (1990s). The focus of PMOs changed significantly in the 1990s. As a 
distinct discipline of its own, project management became a unit of interest to the PMOs, which 
then created standardized project management methodologies, tools, and other tactical aspects 
associated with projects. During this time, formalized project management methodologies 
were introduced, and Project Management Institute’s A Guide to the Project Management Body 
of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) was widely adopted. In this role, PMOs were the custodians of

methodology, responsible for training project managers, developing standard templates and 
processes, and ensuring consistency in executing projects throughout their organizations. 
In addition, during this period, project management software played an important role in 
expanding PMO capabilities. Such technological advancement helped improve an organization’s 
ability to keep track of projects, allocate resources, and report on their progress, making them 
more valuable.
•	 The Strategic Shift (2000s). PMOs started taking a more strategic shape upon moving into 
the new millennium. Portfolio management became a buzzword, and most PMOs aligned 
projects with organizational strategy. This alignment resulted in enterprise project management 
offices (EPMOs), which signified a change in company-wide project oversight toward strategic 
alignment with corporate objectives. New technologies also made more integrated and 
accessible project management tools possible. However, the benefits of these advancements 
were often limited by the need for more organizational maturity in project management 
practices. PMOs were tasked with managing projects and driving organizational change toward 
improving overall project management maturity.
•	 The Agile Challenge (2010s). In the 2010s, there was a rapid rise in agile methodologies that 
presented both a challenge and an opportunity to PMOs. Traditional, control-oriented PMOs 
were questioned; some even claimed they were incompatible with the “new agile world.” This 
situation forced PMOs to review their role and value proposition. PMO professionals began to 
think about how they would be able to generate value for their organizations from the top down 
rather than continue focusing purely on technical aspects like most PMOs. Therefore, this change 
was essential in ensuring the continued relevance and necessity of PMOs amid the changing 
landscape of project management. PMOs started injecting hybrid project environments—
borrowing from both traditional and agile mindsets. They dropped their focus on rigid methods 
to enable agility across organizations.
•	 The Value-Driven Era (Late 2010s to present). More recently, PMOs increasingly realize 
that it is through this generation of organizational value that they can survive and become 
indispensable partners for stakeholders, especially top management. This insight has been 
driven by more proficient leaders within its ranks, who are aided by simplified processes and 
highly automated and integrated tools. Modern-day PMOs bridge gaps between actualities, 
needs, constraints, and challenges faced by the organizations they work for, which allows 
for improved perception or recognition of values associated with them. This improvement 
represents a significant shift in organizational management, where control-centric entities turn 
into value-driven strategic partners. Today’s PMOs are no longer about managing projects; 
instead, they focus on using them to facilitate organizational strategy, make innovation 
realizable, and enhance tangible value creation. Given this complex environment combined 
with the increasing rate of change, PMOs are becoming more critical strategic partners to 
organizations.
It is clear that the evolution of PMOs is still far from over. The most successful will be those that can 
guess and respond to what organizations require at any particular time, take advantage of emergent

Exploring PMO Types and Models: A Spectrum of Approaches
PMO professionals often turn to established models when implementing or redesigning PMOs. 
However, the abundance of available models presents a conundrum: Which one is truly the “best” 
or “right” choice? This dilemma often leads to a problematic assumption that one model is ideal, 
rendering all others obsolete or irrelevant.
This traditional approach—seeking a perfect PMO model as a panacea for all organizational 
challenges—needs to be revised because it encourages organizations to adopt a perceived “ideal” 
model and, if unsuccessful, await the next trend to try again. Such a strategy critically overlooks one 
of the most salient characteristics of PMOs—their inherent uniqueness.
PMOs represent a complex phenomenon that defies universal consensus, unlike the relatively 
standardized practices for portfolio, program, and project management. The truth is that there 
are no empirically proven, universally ideal, or consistently effective PMO models. While various 
models proposed by different authors offer valuable insights, they should not be viewed as mutually 
exclusive paths. Instead, these models should be seen as a palette of options that can potentially be 
combined to meet specific organizational needs.
Figure 3-3 illustrates some of the different PMO types that can be implemented. The most relevant 
literature on PMOs helps to provide a more comprehensive list that includes:
•	 Agile PMO. An agile PMO is specifically designed to support agile project management 
methodologies, such as Scrum, Kanban, or Extreme Programming (XP). This type of PMO focuses 
on fostering agile practices, principles, and values, promoting continuous improvement and 
providing guidance on agile tools and techniques.
•	 Control tower PMO. The control tower PMO has a more active role in project management, 
ensuring that projects comply with established policies, processes, and methodologies. This 
type of PMO oversees project management practices, monitors project performance, and audits 
projects to ensure consistent organizational execution. The control tower PMO is more focused 
on maintaining quality and control over projects.
•	 Consultative PMO. A consultative PMO focuses on providing expert advice, guidance, and 
support to project teams within an organization. This type of PMO is similar to the supportive 
PMO, as it offers a range of services to help project teams improve their project management 
practices and achieve project success. The primary difference is the emphasis on a more 
proactive advisory role in the consultative PMO.
•	 Controlling PMO. The controlling PMO has a moderate-to-high level of control within 
the organization; it enforces compliance with established project management policies, 
methodologies, and frameworks. This PMO type focuses on managing risks, issues, and change 
requests; overseeing project management practices; and ensuring that projects consistently 
follow organizational processes and standards to maintain quality and control.
•	 Departmental PMO. The departmental PMO is specific to a particular department or business 
unit within the organization, providing project management support and guidance tailored to 
that department’s needs.

Understanding the PMO  23
•	 Directive PMO. The directive PMO has a high level of control, actively managing and 
directing projects within the organization. It is suitable for organizations with higher project 
management maturity and a need for centralized control and consistency. This PMO type 
ensures projects are effectively managed and deliver expected results, often having authority 
over project managers and teams and being deeply involved in project management decision-
making processes.
•	 Delivery PMO. The delivery PMO is responsible for managing and delivering projects within 
the organization, providing the necessary tools, processes, and resources. With a moderate level 
of control, it focuses on ensuring that projects are delivered on time, within budget, and to the 
expected quality standards. A delivery PMO supports project teams in executing their projects, 
monitoring progress, and reporting on project performance, and is primarily concerned with the 
day-to-day management and successful completion of projects.
•	 Enterprise PMO (EPMO). An EPMO is a high-level PMO with a broad scope and authority within 
the organization. The EPMO is responsible for overseeing and coordinating all PMO activities, 
ensuring alignment with the organization’s strategic objectives and providing a consistent 
approach to project management across the organization.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
•	 Functional PMO. The functional PMO is responsible for the management of projects within a 
specific functional area or domain, such as IT, human resources, or finance. The functional PMO 
supports that department by providing project management guidance, resources, and tools 
tailored to the specific needs of that domain.
•	 Hybrid PMO. A hybrid PMO combines elements of different PMO types based on the specific 
needs and context of the organization. A hybrid PMO can be tailored to the organization’s 
requirements, offering a more flexible approach to project management.
•	 Innovation PMO. The innovation PMO focuses on driving experimentation within an 
organization by providing support for projects and initiatives aimed at fostering innovation, 
creativity, and new product development. The innovation PMO may work closely with research 
and development (R&D) teams as well as cross-functional project teams.
•	 Operational PMO. An operational PMO focuses on supporting individual projects and project 
teams within an organization. The operational PMO provides project management guidance, 
tools, and resources to ensure the successful execution and delivery of projects. The operational 
PMO has a more tactical role, addressing the day-to-day needs of project teams, and is closely 
aligned with project execution and delivery.
•	 Portfolio management office. The portfolio management office (Pf-PMO) is responsible 
for managing the organization’s entire portfolio of programs, projects, and other work. The 
Pf-PMO oversees the portfolio to ensure alignment with the organization’s strategy, prioritize 
investments, and optimize resource allocation. With the highest level of authority and strategic 
focus, the Pf-PMO plays a crucial role in portfolio management and delivery, ensuring that all 
initiatives support the overall organizational goals.
•	 Program management office. The program management office (Pg-PMO) is responsible for 
managing and coordinating multiple related projects that are part of a larger program. This type 
of PMO focuses on ensuring that the program’s objectives and benefits are achieved, managing 
interdependencies among projects, and providing program-level governance. With a strategic 
role within the organization, the Pg-PMO is closely aligned with program management and 
delivery, ensuring that all projects within the program contribute to the overall program goals.
•	 Project-specific PMO. Sometimes called a project controls office (PCO), a project-specific 
PMO is established to support a single, large-scale, or high-risk project. This type of PMO 
provides dedicated project management support and resources to help ensure the project’s 
successful delivery.
•	 Project support office. A project support office (PSO) provides administrative support and 
coordination for individual projects and project teams within an organization. The PSO ensures 
that project managers have the necessary resources, tools, and guidance to successfully manage 
their projects. A PSO handles activities such as project tracking, reporting, and documentation, 
focusing on the day-to-day needs of project teams. With a more tactical role, the PSO is closely 
aligned with project execution and delivery.
•	 Project management center of excellence. A project management center of excellence 
(PMCoE) is a specialized type of PMO dedicated to promoting and enhancing an organization’s

Understanding the PMO  25
project management capabilities. The PMCoE serves as a central hub for project management 
knowledge, skills, resources, and accepted practices, aiming to improve the organization’s overall 
project management maturity and effectiveness.
•	 Supportive PMO. The supportive PMO focuses on providing support to project teams through 
the provision of tools, templates, accepted practices, and training. The supportive PMO typically 
has a low level of control within the organization and primarily aims to improve project 
management practices by sharing knowledge and resources. The supportive PMO helps project 
teams with day-to-day project management tasks and offers guidance when needed.
•	 Strategic PMO. The strategic PMO focuses on aligning the organization’s portfolios, programs, 
and projects with its strategic objectives and ensuring that they deliver value. The strategic 
PMO involves project prioritization, resource allocation, benefits realization, and governance. 
A strategic PMO typically has a high level of authority within the organization and works 
closely with senior management to ensure that the organization’s project portfolio is 
effectively managed.
•	 Tactical PMO. The tactical PMO is responsible for managing and coordinating multiple 
related projects, ensuring that the organization’s project management processes are followed 
consistently and that good practices are shared. This type of PMO focuses on improving the 
organization’s project management capabilities and serves as a central repository for project 
management knowledge, skills, and resources.
•	 Transformation management office. The transformation management office (TMO) drives 
and manages large-scale organizational change initiatives. The TMO oversees and coordinates 
programs and projects that are critical to achieving strategic goals, ensuring alignment with the 
organization’s vision and strategy.
•	 Value management office. A value management office (VMO) is responsible for ensuring 
that projects deliver maximum value to the organization. The VMO focuses on evaluation, 
prioritization, tracking of project benefits, and return on investment (ROI), ensuring that projects 
align with the organization’s strategic objectives and contribute to its success.
•	 xMO. This concept is centered around the idea that the PMO’s traditional focus on portfolios, 
programs, and projects can be extended to other areas of the organization, where management 
support and expertise can add value. By embracing this broader scope, the xMO can better 
support the organization’s strategic objectives, facilitate cross-functional collaboration, and 
enhance organizational agility. An example of an xMO is the change management office (CMO), 
which focuses on managing organizational change, ensuring that the organization can adapt to 
new strategies, technologies, or business models. 
The literature on PMOs presents a rich tapestry of types, each offering unique perspectives on how 
these entities can function within organizations. This diversity reflects the complex and multifaceted 
nature of PMOs and the varied needs of the organizations they serve. 
In analyzing the types of PMOs described in this section, each one approaches the subject from one 
of the following perspectives:

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
•	 Scope of coverage. The type of PMO is defined by its scope of influence, which can range 
from overseeing the entire organization to a specific department or division, or even a single 
program or project. Each type of PMO addresses unique needs and operates within different 
scopes, emphasizing the importance of context-specific structures in project management. 
The main types include departmental PMOs, EPMOs, project-specific PMOs, Pg-PMOs, and 
functional PMOs.
•	 Service approach. The type of PMO is determined by its operational approach, which can 
be consultative, controlling, or directive. The primary types include the control tower PMO, 
consultative PMO, supportive PMO, directive PMO, and PSO. Each PMO type adapts its service 
approach to best meet the organization’s needs, balancing guidance, support, and control. 
•	 Type of functions. The type of PMO is determined by the set of functions it provides, which can 
be operational, tactical, strategic, or any other specific combination of predetermined functions. 
The primary types include the agile PMO, delivery PMO, innovation PMO, operational PMO, 
Pf-PMO, PMCoE, strategic PMO, tactical PMO, and VMO.
•	 Flexible models. More recently, new approaches emphasizing greater flexibility have emerged. 
While still categorized as specific types, these approaches gradually break away from rigid 
classifications, proposing a more adaptable approach grounded in each organization’s unique 
needs. The primary types include hybrid PMOs and xMOs.
Each approach offers valuable insights into how PMOs can be structured and operated. However, 
it is crucial to understand that no single type should be considered a universal solution. Instead, 
these models should inspire PMO professionals to develop tailored solutions that address their 
organization’s unique needs.
The Limitations of Traditional PMO Types
While the various PMO types outlined in the literature provide valuable insights, they also present 
several limitations when applied rigidly:
•	 Oversimplification. Predefined models often fail to capture the full complexity of an 
organization’s needs.
•	 Static nature. These models may not account for the dynamic, ever-changing nature of business 
environments.
•	 One-size-fits-all mentality. These models can lead to a cookie-cutter approach that does not 
address unique organizational challenges.
•	 Focus on structure over value. There is a risk of prioritizing adherence to a model over 
delivering tangible benefits.
Rigidly adhering to one of these models often forces an organization to conform to a perspective 
that does not align with its unique context.

Understanding the PMO  27
Reimagining PMO Models: Beyond One-Size-Fits-All Solutions
The evolution of PMOs reflects a growing understanding that flexibility and customization are key 
to their success. Empirical evidence consistently shows that the most-valued PMOs craft bespoke 
structures tailored to their unique organizational context rather than rigidly adhering to a single, 
predefined model. 
While the project management literature offers a rich array of PMO models, each with valuable 
insights, treating these as universal solutions can be counterproductive. Organizations are dynamic 
entities with ever-changing needs, and PMOs should mirror this adaptability to remain relevant 
and practical.
The danger lies in the temptation to seek a “perfect” PMO model or to jump from one trendy type 
to another. Such approaches often lead to misalignment between the PMO and the organization’s 
actual needs, resulting in decreased value perception and effectiveness. 
Instead of rigidly categorizing PMOs or adhering strictly to predefined types, successful PMOs often 
exhibit a blend of characteristics drawn from multiple types. This hybridization allows them to create 
a unique structure that best serves their context and stakeholder needs.
As organizations face new challenges and opportunities, new PMO types will inevitably emerge. 
However, the key to success lies not in adopting these new types wholesale, but in drawing 
inspiration from them to further refine and adapt existing PMO structures. 
PMO professionals should focus on creating and continuously evolving tailored models 
based on their organization’s specific needs. They should recognize that the label or category 
assigned to a PMO becomes far less important than its effectiveness and alignment with 
organizational goals.
The most successful PMOs of the future will transcend rigid categorizations and create genuinely 
customized structures. By embracing flexibility, focusing on stakeholder needs, and continually 
adapting to change, PMOs can position themselves as indispensable strategic partners in 
organizational success. 
This evolution in PMO thinking represents not just a change in structure or function but a 
fundamental shift in how people perceive the role of project management within organizations. 
It is a move toward a more nuanced, context-specific approach that addresses each organization’s 
unique challenges and opportunities.
In this new paradigm, the “best” PMO is not one that perfectly fits a predefined model but one that 
perfectly fits its organization—today, tomorrow, and into the future. By embracing this flexible, 
adaptive approach, PMOs can help ensure their continued relevance and value in an increasingly 
complex and fast-paced business world, driving organizational success through tailored, effective 
project management practices.

Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
The Organizational Context Scenarios framework outlined in this section is crucial for PMO 
professionals. The scenarios provide valuable insights into how PMO professionals can identify the 
current context in their organization, enabling them to develop and apply contextually relevant 
strategies. By understanding these scenarios, PMO professionals can tailor their approaches to fit the 
unique challenges and opportunities within their organizations, enhancing their ability to deliver 
effective solutions.
Ultimately, this section equips PMO professionals with the knowledge and tools to navigate the 
complexities of PMO management across various types of organizational scenarios. Whether 
working in low-maturity environments, launching a new PMO, maximizing the success of 
existing PMOs, preventing PMO decline, or even reintroducing a PMO after a previous failure, 
PMO professionals face a range of challenges that require strategic insight and adaptability. 
By understanding these diverse scenarios, professionals can implement targeted strategies that 
address specific organizational needs and drive sustainable success.
The Organizational Contextual Scenarios Dynamics
PMOs are not static; they evolve, adapt, and sometimes encounter difficulties as they progress 
through different contextual scenarios. The Organizational Contextual Scenarios framework 
offers a detailed framework to understand these dynamics, providing valuable insights 
into the various challenges and opportunities that PMOs may face at different points in 
their journey.
To fully appreciate the significance of this framework, it is essential to consider its place within 
the broader context of organizational theory and project management practice. The framework 
aligns with systems thinking principles, recognizing that PMOs do not exist in isolation but 
are part of a complex organizational ecosystem. Each scenario in the framework reflects the 
internal PMO state, its interactions with various stakeholders, and its response to external 
environmental factors.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
The framework also touches upon aspects of organizational behavior, culture, and maturity. The 
initial scenarios highlight the importance of cultural readiness and executive buy-in for PMO 
success. The framework’s recognition of potential decline and collapse scenarios, even if they are not 
the inevitable destiny for every PMO, serves as a reminder that PMOs should consistently articulate 
and demonstrate their value proposition.
Finally, the inclusion of a resurgence scenario in the framework is particularly noteworthy, as it 
acknowledges the potential for organizational learning and renewal. This concept aligns with 
theories of organizational resilience and adaptive capacity, suggesting that even after significant 
setbacks, PMOs can evolve and reestablish their value proposition.
As organizations grapple with increasing complexity and uncertainty in their project environments, 
the Organizational Contextual Scenarios framework offers a valuable compass for navigating these 
challenges and achieving potential opportunities. The framework encourages a dynamic and 
adaptive approach to PMO management, recognizing that the PMO’s role and focus may need to 
adapt in response to changing organizational needs and external pressures.
With a closer look at each of the eight scenarios, it becomes evident that this framework is not 
just a theoretical construct but a practical tool for guiding PMO strategies and operations. The 
framework offers a roadmap for navigating the complex journey of PMO development, adaptation, 
and renewal, providing insights that can help organizations maximize the value they derive from 
their PMOs.
Understanding the Eight Organizational Contextual Scenarios
Experience shows that organizations may go through distinct contextual scenarios that significantly 
impact their PMO initiatives. Eight scenarios that typically influence PMO initiatives have been 
identified, and each one presents its own unique challenges and opportunities. Recognizing the 
current organizational context can significantly shape the PMO strategy.
Understanding these scenarios is crucial for tailoring the PMO strategy. Each scenario requires a 
different approach, and recognizing the current organizational context is the first step in aligning 
the PMO with organizational needs. PMOs that understand and adapt to these scenarios thrive in 
the long run.
There is no assumption of linear progression through these scenarios. In reality, PMOs may not 
always transition through stages in a predictable sequence. Some PMOs may skip certain scenarios 
or experience them in a different order, and various parts of the PMO may mature at different 
rates or exist in different stages simultaneously, depending on the unique strategic needs and 
circumstances of the organization. This nonlinear and dynamic nature emphasizes the importance 
of flexibility when applying this model.
Figure 4-1 illustrates the eight organizational contextual scenarios, each representing a distinct state 
in the organization’s journey, highlighting the unique characteristics, challenges, and opportunities 
faced by PMO professionals at each stage.

Potential Scenario
This first scenario represents the earliest state of a PMO initiative. The organization recognizes 
the potential benefits of a PMO but lacks the necessary cultural foundation or maturity to 
implement one effectively. Although the organization is not ready for a PMO, the potential exists. 
It is necessary to focus on changing the organizational culture before considering setting up 
a PMO.
Though experts see the potential for a beautiful tree in a few years, they also know the current 
scenario is akin to fertile ground awaiting cultivation. The soil has potential fertility but requires 
adequate preparation to become suitable for planting. Proper preparation, including tilling and 
enriching the soil, is essential to transform this potential into a robust and flourishing tree.
This scenario is characterized by:
•	 High-potential environment. The organization has recognized the benefits of a PMO but is not 
yet prepared for implementation.
•	 Absence of formal project management structures or processes. There are no established 
frameworks or methodologies in place.

Executive leadership demonstrates sufficient awareness of the potential contributions of a PMO, 
enabling initial buy-in and a basic understanding of its value. A minimal level of project management 
culture and maturity has been established, allowing for the initial implementation of a PMO.
This scenario is analogous to a fertile piece of land being ready for planting after careful preparation. 
The soil has been tilled and enriched, creating the ideal conditions for seeds to thrive. The land is 
poised to support robust growth and a bountiful harvest.
This scenario is characterized by:
•	 Introduction of basic project management frameworks and methodologies. Implement 
foundational project management practices to guide initial projects.
•	 Setup of early-stage projects and processes. Establish preliminary processes and start the 
initial projects to demonstrate PMO capabilities.
•	 Executive buy-in and initial support for the PMO concept. Gain the necessary executive 
sponsorship and support to initiate the PMO.

Key Focus Areas for Development
By focusing on the following areas, the organization can maintain and enhance the PMO’s 
peak performance, helping to ensure it continues to deliver substantial value and support the 
achievement of strategic goals.
•	 Sustaining excellence. Maintain high standards of project management and continuously seek 
opportunities for improvement.
•	 Innovation. Encourage innovation and adopt new methodologies and technologies to stay 
ahead.
•	 Stakeholder relationship management. Strengthen and maintain strong relationships with 
stakeholders to help ensure ongoing support and engagement.
•	 Recognition and reward. Recognize and reward the contributions of the PMO team to sustain 
motivation and high performance.
Crisis Scenario
This scenario marks a turning point where the organization faces challenges that impact the PMO’s 
value proposition. Stakeholders may struggle to perceive the PMO’s value, and executive support 
begins to wane.
This scenario is like a once-vibrant plant starting to wilt. Deprived of nutrients, it declines in vitality 
and impact unless intervention revives its strength. The plant’s leaves begin to yellow and fall, 
symbolizing its struggle to survive. Without timely care and the restoration of essential resources, 
the tree faces an inevitable decline, highlighting the urgent need for immediate action to restore its 
health and vitality.
This scenario is characterized by the following:
•	 Processes, systems, and artifacts are not used. If the PMO has developed processes, systems, 
and artifacts that are not being used, it is a sign that the PMO is not meeting their customer’s 
needs or delivering the expected benefits.
•	 Constant complaints about the PMO performance. If customers constantly complain about 
the PMO’s performance, it is a sign that the PMO is not delivering the expected benefits or 
meeting their needs.
•	 Reduction of PMO autonomy. If the PMO’s autonomy is being reduced, it is a sign that the 
organization may not be committed to the PMO or that the PMO is not delivering the expected 
benefits.
•	 PMO customers complain about bureaucracy. If stakeholders complain that the PMO is adding 
unnecessary bureaucracy and slowing down the project delivery process, it is a sign that the 
PMO may not be effectively balancing the need for governance with the need for agility.

•	 Resistance to the PMO does not subside over time. If customers continue to resist the PMO’s 
efforts, even after it has been in operation for some time, it is a sign that the PMO is not meeting 
their needs or delivering the expected benefits.
•	 The PMO is not invited to attend important meetings. If the PMO is not being invited to 
attend important meetings, it is a sign that it is not seen as a strategic partner within the 
organization.
•	 Decreasing efficiency and effectiveness in project delivery. Projects are increasingly delayed, 
over budget, or failing to meet quality standards.
Key Focus Areas for Development
Addressing the following focus areas can stabilize the PMO, mitigate immediate challenges, and lay 
the groundwork for recovery and renewed growth.
•	 Diagnostic assessment. Conduct a thorough evaluation to identify the root causes of the crisis.
•	 Stakeholder reengagement. Actively communicate with stakeholders to rebuild trust and 
demonstrate the PMO’s value.
•	 Resource reallocation. Ensure the PMO has the necessary resources to overcome challenges.
•	 Process improvement. Identify and implement improvements to enhance efficiency and 
effectiveness.
•	 Leadership intervention. Strong leadership is crucial to guide the PMO through the crisis and 
ensure timely corrective actions.
Decline Scenario
If the organizational crisis is not effectively managed, this scenario emerges. The PMO is losing 
support rapidly and struggling to demonstrate or deliver on its expected value. Resistance to 
PMO activities intensifies, and its necessity comes into question. Even drastic measures may prove 
insufficient to halt the downward trajectory, as reversing the decline requires a herculean effort.
This scenario is like a tree suffering from severe neglect, with its leaves dying and falling off. The 
neglected plant’s survival is in doubt as it struggles to maintain any vitality. Attempts to stop its 
decline might fail because its roots are weak and its branches are brittle. Without immediate and 
comprehensive intervention, the plant faces an almost certain demise, highlighting the critical need 
for timely care and resources to potentially revive and restore its health.
Key characteristics of this scenario include:
•	 Loss of executive-level support. When executives begin to question the PMO’s value, it is a 
clear sign that the PMO may not be delivering what it should.
•	 Eroding PMO customer support and engagement. PMO customers are disengaging and 
losing faith in the PMO’s ability to add value.

•	 Constant changes in PMO leadership. A high turnover rate within the PMO leadership team is 
a sign that the organization may not be committed to the PMO or that the PMO is not delivering 
the expected benefits.
•	 High turnover in the PMO team. Similarly, a high turnover rate within the PMO team is a sign 
that the team may not be functioning effectively or that there are deeper issues at play.
•	 Cost-cutting in the PMO. If the PMO is subject to cost-cutting measures, it is a sign that the 
organization may not see it as a strategic partner or that it is not delivering the expected benefits.
•	 The PMO’s performance is often sabotaged. If customers actively work to sabotage the PMO’s 
efforts, it is a sign that a deeper issue is at play, and the PMO urgently needs to reassess its approach.
•	 PMO customers hide information from the PMO. If customers withhold information from the 
PMO, it is a sign that they do not trust the PMO or do not believe it is providing value.
Key Focus Areas for Development
Addressing the following focus areas can help the organization attempt to halt the PMO’s downward 
trajectory, stabilize its operations, and create opportunities for potential recovery and revitalization.
•	 Immediate intervention. Act quickly to stabilize the PMO by addressing the most critical 
issues first.
•	 Rebuild trust. Engage with stakeholders to rebuild trust and demonstrate a commitment to 
reversing the decline.
•	 Resource allocation. Ensure that adequate resources are allocated to support the PMO’s 
recovery efforts.
•	 Process reevaluation. Review and improve current processes to enhance efficiency and 
effectiveness.
•	 Leadership and guidance. Strong leadership is crucial to guide the PMO through this 
challenging period and restore its credibility and value.
Collapse Scenario
In this scenario, the organizational context is such that the PMO ceases to function effectively or 
becomes obsolete. Lacking executive backing, autonomy, resources, and influence, the PMO fails to 
deliver minimal value, rendering it dispensable to the organization. This scenario is undesirable but 
sometimes necessary for a fresh start. It represents the potential end of the PMO’s life cycle within 
the current organizational context.
This scenario is like a plant that has withered beyond recovery. Deprived of sunlight, water, and 
nutrients, it no longer grows or blooms, becoming lifeless. The plant, lacking necessary support and 
resources, fails to sustain even minimal vitality, which sometimes signifies the end of its life cycle. 
This inevitable decline reflects the consequences of prolonged neglect and insufficient intervention, 
emphasizing the critical need for consistent care and resources to sustain life.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
Characteristics of this scenario include:
•	 Complete breakdown of PMO processes and governance. The PMO can no longer maintain 
any of its established processes or governance structures.
•	 Total loss of stakeholder confidence and support. Stakeholders no longer believe in the 
PMO’s ability to add value, resulting in a complete withdrawal of support.
•	 Inability to manage projects effectively. Projects suffer due to the lack of effective 
management, leading to frequent failures.
•	 Consideration of disbanding the PMO. The organization seriously considers dissolving the 
PMO as it no longer serves its purpose.
Key Focus Areas for Development
Addressing the following focus areas can help the organization determine the best course of action, 
whether it involves attempting to revive the PMO or deciding to disband it and start a new one.
•	 Root cause analysis. Conduct a thorough analysis to understand the underlying reasons for the 
PMO’s collapse.
•	 Stakeholder communication. Communicate openly with stakeholders about the challenges 
and potential solutions.
•	 Strategic decision-making. Decide whether to attempt a PMO revival or to disband and 
start fresh.
•	 Resource reallocation. If revival is chosen, allocate the necessary resources to address 
deficiencies.
•	 Leadership and vision. Strong leadership is essential to either guide the revival process or 
manage the transition to a new structure.
Resurgence Scenario
In this scenario, the organizational context allows for the PMO idea to be reborn. This reemergence 
can be complex and risky, potentially complicated by organizational trauma from past experiences. 
While challenging, this scenario can lead to an even more robust PMO if managed correctly. It 
represents a potential rebirth of the PMO concept, often rising from the ashes of previous failures.
This scenario is like a dormant seed sprouting anew after a wildfire. Like a seedling facing the 
remnants of a forest fire, with the right care and procedures, the new plant can grow stronger than 
before. This process involves overcoming significant challenges, but if managed correctly, it can 
result in a more robust and resilient tree. The rebirth from the ashes symbolizes renewal and the 
potential for greater strength, demonstrating the power of effective management and nurturing.

This scenario is characterized by:
•	 Renewed focus on rebuilding and improving the PMO. Concentrate efforts on reconstructing 
the PMO with improved strategies.
•	 Reestablishment of governance and processes. Implement robust governance frameworks 
and refined processes.
•	 Reengagement of stakeholders with a refreshed strategy. Reconnect with stakeholders 
through a newly devised strategy to gain their support.
•	 Early signs of recovery and improvement. Look for initial indicators of positive changes and 
enhanced performance.
•	 Learning from previous failure. Apply lessons learned from past setbacks to avoid repeating 
mistakes and help strengthen the PMO.
Key Focus Areas for Development
By focusing on these areas, the organization can successfully navigate the complexities of 
reestablishing the PMO, leading to a more resilient and effective project management office that 
supports organizational goals.
•	 Customer-centric and value-driven practices. Implement the new PMO based on established 
practices that focus on customer needs and delivering value.
•	 Change management. Effectively manage the transition and address any organizational 
resistance.
•	 Stakeholder communication. Ensure transparent communication to rebuild trust and 
demonstrate renewed value.
•	 Continuous improvement. Implement mechanisms for ongoing assessment and enhancement 
of PMO practices.
•	 Resource optimization. Ensure the optimal use of resources to support the resurgence efforts.
•	 Leadership and vision. Apply strong leadership to guide the resurgence and inspire confidence 
among stakeholders.
Signs of Transition Between Scenarios
The transition between these organizational contextual scenarios is rarely a sudden event but rather 
a gradual process marked by several key indicators. Recognizing these signals is crucial for proactive 
PMO management and timely intervention. While specific indicators may vary depending on the 
organization and its context, several common signs often herald a shift from one state to another.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
Here are some examples:
•	 Stakeholder perception and support. As a PMO moves from a growing to a thriving state, 
there is typically an increase in positive feedback from stakeholders, greater engagement in 
PMO initiatives, and more frequent requests for PMO services. Conversely, a shift toward the 
crisis state might be signaled by growing skepticism about the PMO’s value, reduced stakeholder 
participation (particularly at the executive level), and increased resistance to PMO-led initiatives.
•	 Executive support. A transition to a more positive state is often accompanied by increased 
executive backing, manifesting as greater resource allocation, more frequent inclusion in 
strategic discussions, or expanded PMO authority. On the other hand, waning executive support, 
such as budget cuts or reduced access to leadership, can signal a move toward less favorable 
states.
•	 Performance metrics. A PMO moving toward a thriving state typically shows consistent 
improvement in KPIs such as on-time delivery, budget adherence, and stakeholder satisfaction. 
Conversely, declining project success rates or increasing numbers of troubled projects might 
indicate a shift toward crisis or decline states.
•	 PMO’s ability to adapt and innovate. A PMO moving toward more positive states often 
demonstrates increasing agility, regularly introducing new methodologies or tools to improve 
project delivery. Stagnation in processes or resistance to change, on the other hand, might 
indicate a move toward less favorable states.
•	 Organizational alignment. As a PMO moves toward more positive states, there is typically 
increasing alignment between PMO activities and organizational strategic objectives. A 
disconnect between PMO focus and organizational priorities might signal a shift toward crisis or 
decline states.
•	 Quality and quantity of PMO outputs. A move toward more positive states is often marked by 
an increase in the volume and quality of PMO deliverables such as reports, training sessions, or 
process improvements. A decline in these outputs, or a decrease in their perceived value, might 
signal a transition to less favorable states.
•	 Team morale and turnover within the PMO. A PMO moving toward more positive states often 
experiences improved team morale, lower turnover rates, and an ability to attract top talent. 
Increasing turnover, difficulty in recruiting, or low team morale might signal a transition toward 
less favorable states.
•	 PMO’s influence on organizational culture. As a PMO moves toward more positive states, 
there is typically a growing project management culture across the organization, with increased 
adoption of PMO-recommended practices. A decline in this cultural influence might signal a shift 
toward less favorable states.
•	 PMO’s role in decision-making processes. A transition to more positive states is often 
accompanied by the PMO playing an increasingly strategic role, being consulted on major 
decisions that impact portfolio and project management. A reduction in this decision-making 
influence might signal a move toward less favorable states.

•	 Organizational changes. Changes within the organization can also trigger transitions between 
states. Structural shifts, leadership changes, or shifts in strategic direction can all impact the 
PMO’s state.
It is important to note that these indicators should not be considered in isolation but rather as 
part of a holistic assessment of the PMO’s health. A combination of these indicators often signals 
the transition between states, and the significance of each may vary depending on the specific 
organizational context.
Regular monitoring of these indicators can help PMO professionals and organizational executives to 
identify state transitions early, allowing for timely and appropriate strategic responses.
Strategies for Different Organizational Contextual Scenarios
Each organizational contextual scenario presents unique challenges and opportunities. Recognizing 
these states allows organizations to implement targeted strategies that are most appropriate for 
their status quo. These strategies are not one-size-fits-all solutions but rather tailored approaches 
designed to maximize success.
For PMO professionals, having a toolkit of strategies for each scenario is invaluable. Having different 
strategies at hand can enable PMO professionals to proactively address challenges and exploit 
opportunities for growth and improvement. These strategies serve as a starting point for developing 
tailored approaches that consider the unique context and needs of each organization.
Detailed and extensive strategies for each organizational contextual scenario are outlined in Table 4-1.
In each of these scenarios, it is crucial for PMO professionals to remain adaptable, maintain open 
communication with stakeholders, and continuously align the PMO’s efforts with organizational 
needs and strategic objectives. By applying these strategies, PMO professionals can effectively 
navigate the challenges and opportunities presented at each stage of the PMO life cycle, ensuring 
the PMO’s relevance and value to the organization.
The Organizational Contextual Scenarios framework provides valuable insights into the dynamics of 
PMOs, offering a structured approach to understanding their most common states. This framework 
serves as a powerful tool for PMO professionals, guiding their strategies and decision-making processes.
The framework’s key strength lies in its structured understanding of organizational scenarios, 
categorizing them into eight distinct states. This categorization provides clarity and a common 
language, enabling PMO professionals to communicate more effectively about their organization’s 
current state and future direction and helping them to tailor their approaches to specific 
organizational contexts.
Despite these benefits, the framework has limitations that warrant consideration. One primary concern 
is the risk of oversimplification. The eight distinct scenarios may not fully capture the complex and 
fluid nature of real-world PMOs, which often exhibit characteristics of multiple states simultaneously. 
This complexity can make it challenging to neatly categorize a PMO into a single scenario.

Another limitation is the assumption of linear progression. In reality, PMOs may not always progress 
through states in a predictable sequence. Some may skip certain states or experience them in a 
different order, reflecting the unique strategic needs and circumstances of each organization. This 
nonlinear nature emphasizes the need for flexibility in applying the framework.
The framework’s effectiveness can also be limited by contextual variations. What constitutes success 
for one PMO might differ significantly for another, underscoring the importance of customization 
in its application. PMO professionals should adapt the framework to their specific organizational 
culture, goals, and challenges.
The treatment of the resurgence scenario, while valuable, presents another area for consideration. 
While it offers one path forward after a PMO’s collapse, it is important to recognize that 
organizations have multiple options. Some organizations may choose to reimagine their project 
management approach entirely rather than resurrect a previous model. Acknowledging this range 
of possibilities makes the framework more comprehensive and practical.
To maximize the benefits of the framework while mitigating its limitations, PMO professionals 
should adopt a flexible approach to its application. This approach involves recognizing that 
PMOs may exhibit characteristics of multiple scenarios simultaneously and adapting strategies 
accordingly. Continuous assessment is crucial, regularly evaluating the PMO’s state and adjusting 
approaches as needed, rather than rigidly adhering to predefined paths.
Customization is key to effective implementation. The framework should be tailored to specific 
organizational contexts, acknowledging that success metrics may vary across different PMOs. It is 
also important to view the framework as part of a broader toolkit for PMO management, integrating 
it with other relevant models and practices for a more holistic approach.

In conclusion, the Organizational Contextual Scenarios framework provides a valuable foundation 
for understanding and managing different scenarios encountered within organizations. By 
recognizing its limitations and embracing its flexibility, PMO professionals can apply the framework 
more effectively to their unique situations.
Looking Ahead to the Next Section
As PMOs continue to navigate diverse organizational landscapes, a significant shift in thinking has 
emerged: the move toward a value-driven service provider model. This evolution marks a profound 
change in how PMOs function and contribute to organizations. By adopting a service-oriented 
mindset, PMOs can transition from rigid, process-centric entities to dynamic, customer-focused 
partners, committed to improving project outcomes and driving overall organizational success. This 
shift naturally complements the adaptability required in various organizational scenarios.
In the next section, the specifics of this value-driven approach and how it empowers PMOs to 
remain agile, responsive, and invaluable across different contexts are explored, as well as how PMOs 
can leverage this new mindset to maximize their effectiveness and impact.

The PMO as a Value-Driven 
Service Provider
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
This section is vital for PMO professionals, offering insights into service-oriented PMOs and agility 
principles. The information in this section equips PMO professionals with tools to adapt practices, 
enhance responsiveness to changing business needs, and foster continuous improvement.
The section also addresses the challenge of justifying a PMO’s existence, emphasizing customer 
perceptions in value recognition. Details are provided to help empower professionals to shift from 
process enforcement to value creation and perception management, positioning the PMO as an 
indispensable strategic asset.
By embracing a service provider model and agile mindset, PMOs can align with organizational 
goals, boost stakeholder satisfaction, and demonstrate measurable value. This approach is crucial in 
today’s dynamic environment, where adaptability and value delivery are paramount.
Reimagining the PMO as a Service Provider
A service provider is an entity—whether an individual, team, or organization—that offers 
specialized services to meet the specific needs of its customers. These providers possess unique 
expertise, resources, and capabilities in particular fields, delivering value through intangible benefits 
rather than physical products.
Service providers are characterized by their intense focus on understanding and fulfilling customer 
needs. They operate under defined service agreements, continuously adapting their offerings to 
meet evolving demands. This adaptability and customer-centric approach have made the service-
provider model increasingly relevant in our dynamic business environment.
PMOs stand at a critical juncture in their evolution. Traditionally viewed as administrative bodies 
focused on enforcing standards and processes, PMOs now have the opportunity to reimagine their 
role within organizations.
By adopting a service-provider mindset, PMOs can transform from rigid, process-focused entities 
into dynamic, customer-oriented partners dedicated to enhancing project success and driving 
organizational performance.

This shift represents a fundamental transformation in how PMOs operate and deliver value. 
At its core, the service-provider mindset places the needs and satisfaction of the PMO’s 
“customers”—project managers, executives, team members, and other stakeholders—at 
the forefront of all operations. This perspective transforms the PMO from an administrative 
or control-focused unit into a valuable, strategic asset that actively contributes to the 
organization’s success.
Adopting a service-provider approach allows PMOs to:
•	 Align more closely with organizational goals and strategies.
•	 Enhance their responsiveness to changing project and business needs.
•	 Improve stakeholder satisfaction and engagement.
•	 Demonstrate clear, measurable value to the organization.
•	 Foster a culture of continuous improvement and innovation in project management practices.
This section will explore the key characteristics of service-oriented PMOs, compare them 
with traditional PMO structures, and examine the benefits and implementation challenges of 
this approach.
By understanding and embracing the service-provider mindset, PMOs can position themselves 
as indispensable partners in organizational success, driving project excellence and strategic 
achievement in an increasingly complex business world.
The transformation of a PMO into a service-oriented entity involves adopting several key 
characteristics that distinguish it from traditional PMO models. These characteristics reflect a 
fundamental shift in focus, priorities, and operational approach. By embracing these traits, PMOs 
can position themselves as valuable, customer-centric service providers within their organizations. 
The core characteristics that define a service-oriented PMO and how each trait contributes to a 
more dynamic, responsive, and value-driven approach to project management are outlined in 
Table 5-1.
The key attributes of the approaches not only differentiate service-oriented PMOs from their 
traditional counterparts but also enable them to adapt more effectively to the ever-changing needs 
of modern organizations and their diverse project portfolios.
Adopting a Service-Provider Mindset
The service-provider mindset represents a powerful evolution in how PMOs operate and 
deliver value. By focusing on customer needs, offering flexible and tailored services, proactively 
engaging with stakeholders, and continuously improving based on feedback, PMOs can 
position themselves as indispensable partners in achieving project success and driving 
organizational strategy.

The PMO as a Value-Driven Service Provider  47
Table 5-1.  Traditional, Process-Focused PMO Versus a Modern, Service-Oriented PMO
Process-Focused PMOs
Service-Oriented PMOs
Standards enforcement: Only enforces standards, 
processes, and methodologies across the organization
Value delivery: Prioritizes delivering value to customers 
within the organization
Process-centric: Emphasizes adherence to established 
project management processes
Customer-centric: Puts the needs of its customers at 
the forefront
Uniform practices: Strong emphasis on creating and 
maintaining uniform practices across all projects
Flexible adaptation: Maintains necessary standards 
while flexibly adapting practices to meet specific project 
needs
Reactive approach: Often responds to issues as they 
arise rather than proactively addressing potential 
challenges
Proactive approach: Actively engages with projects 
and departments, offering support and guidance before 
issues arise
Output-focused: Often focuses heavily on generating 
and distributing reports on project status and metrics
Outcome-focused: Offers a clear set of services to 
generate the customers’ expected outcomes
One-size-fits-all approach: Tends to apply the same 
approaches across all projects regardless of specific 
needs
Tailored approaches: Recognizes that different projects 
and departments may require different approaches and 
tailors services accordingly
Rigid structure: Tends to be more rigid and slower to 
adapt to changing organizational needs
Agile adaptation: More agile and can quickly adapt to 
changing organizational needs
Process compliance: Measures success by compliance 
with processes
Value for the customer: Measures efficacy, customer 
satisfaction, and value delivered
The most important characteristics of a PMO established with a service-provider mindset include:
•	 Customer focus. Prioritize understanding and meeting the needs of internal customers. Place 
customer needs and satisfaction at the forefront of all operations. Proactively engage with 
customers to understand their individual needs and offer solutions.
•	 Value delivery. The primary goal is to deliver value to the organization. Success is measured by 
customer satisfaction and value delivered, not just project outcomes or process adherence.
•	 Specialized expertise. PMOs offer specialized knowledge in project management. This 
expertise is a service provided to various departments and teams within the organization.
•	 Service offerings. Like external service providers, PMOs should have a clear catalog of services 
they offer to their internal customers.
•	 Scalability. PMOs can often scale their services based on organizational needs, offering more 
intensive support for high-priority projects or scaling back for departments with high project 
management maturity.

•	 Proactive engagement. PMOs proactively engage with customers to understand their needs 
and offer solutions, rather than simply reacting to requests.
•	 Relationship management. PMOs focus on building and maintaining strong relationships with 
their customers, a key characteristic of successful service providers.
•	 Performance metrics. Like other service providers, PMOs should measure and report on their 
performance, demonstrating their value to the organization.
•	 Continuous improvement. PMOs regularly refine and adapt their services based on feedback 
and changing organizational needs, much like external service providers evolve to meet market 
demands.
This approach not only enhances the perceived value of the PMO but also contributes to better 
project outcomes, improved stakeholder satisfaction, and ultimately, greater organizational 
success.
The future of PMOs lies not just in methodologies and processes but in the ability to understand, 
anticipate, and meet the evolving needs of organizational customers. As organizations continue 
to face complex challenges in rapidly changing environments, PMOs that embrace this service-
oriented approach will be well positioned to adapt, thrive, and drive meaningful value.
By viewing the PMO through the lens of a service provider, organizations can leverage their 
capabilities more effectively, leading to improved project outcomes, better resource utilization, and 
stronger alignment between project execution and organizational strategy.
The Agility Foundation for PMO Practice
The journey toward an agility-driven PMO begins with a deep understanding of the Manifesto for 
Agile Software Development and its principles. Created in 2001 by a group of software developers, 
the Agile Manifesto was a response to the limitations of traditional, plan-driven approaches to 
software development. While initially focused on software, the principles outlined in the manifesto 
contain universal truths that can be powerfully applied to PMO operations and organizational 
management at large.
The concept of agility has transcended its origins in software development to become a crucial 
paradigm for PMOs. As organizations face increasingly complex challenges and dynamic 
environments, traditional PMO approaches often fall short of delivering the responsiveness and 
value required for success.
The Agile Manifesto contains values and principles that can be powerfully applied to PMOs. 
By adapting them to the PMO context, a framework for more flexible, value-driven, and 
customer-centric PMOs can be created.
This adaptation is not merely about adopting agile approaches and methodologies for project 
execution. Instead, it represents a fundamental shift in how PMOs operate, interact with customers, 
and deliver value to the organization. It requires rethinking the PMO through the lens of agility,

The PMO as a Value-Driven Service Provider  49
emphasizing continuous delivery, embracing change, fostering collaboration, and prioritizing value 
over rigid processes.
The Agile Manifesto’s four core values offer a transformative perspective on how PMOs can operate 
more effectively in today’s dynamic business environment. By reinterpreting and applying these 
values in the context of PMO operations, organizations can emphasize the importance of human 
interactions over rigid processes, the delivery of valuable services over extensive planning, close 
customer engagement over strict service-level agreements, and flexibility and adaptability over 
rigid adherence to plans.
Each of these four values can be reinterpreted and applied in the context of PMO operations:
1.	 People and relationships over rigid processes. This principle emphasizes the importance 
of human interactions and team dynamics in achieving success. For PMOs, this means shifting 
focus from enforcing rigid processes to fostering effective collaboration and communication. 
In practice, this might include implementing more flexible work structures, encouraging 
cross-functional collaboration, and prioritizing team-building activities.
2.	 Delivering valuable services over extensive planning. Just as agile software development 
prioritizes working software over comprehensive documentation, an agility-driven PMO 
should focus on delivering tangible value to its customers rather than getting delayed 
with excessive planning or documentation. This does not mean abandoning planning 
altogether but rather adopting a more iterative approach, where plans are regularly revisited 
and adjusted based on feedback and changing circumstances. PMOs should strive to 
deliver services and support in incremental, valuable chunks rather than waiting for large, 
comprehensive rollouts.
3.	 Close customer engagement over strict service-level agreements. This principle underscores 
the importance of ongoing collaboration and communication with customers. For PMOs, this 
means moving beyond rigid service-level agreements to foster genuine partnerships with 
their internal customers. The engagement effort involves actively seeking feedback, cocreating 
solutions, and maintaining an ongoing dialogue to ensure PMO services remain aligned with 
evolving organizational needs.
4.	 Flexibility and adaptability over rigid adherence to plans. A PMO’s ability to respond 
quickly to change is crucial. This means developing the PMO’s capacity to pivot quickly when 
circumstances change rather than stubbornly adhering to outdated plans or processes. In 
practice, this might involve implementing more flexible services or developing rapid response 
capabilities to address emerging customer needs.
Beyond these four values, the Agile Manifesto also outlined 12 principles that can be adapted 
to the PMO context, providing a roadmap for PMOs seeking to enhance their agility, relevance, 
and impact within their organizations. These principles offer a guiding framework for PMOs 
to evolve from process-centric entities to strategic, value-driven partners in organizational 
success.

The 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto adapted to a PMO context are:
  1.	 The highest priority is to satisfy the organization through early and continuous delivery of 
valuable and adaptable PMO services.
  2.	 Embrace changing organizational priorities and the needs of PMO customers even late in 
PMO initiative development. The PMO should leverage change to enhance its value, the 
organization’s competitive advantage, and its strategic flexibility.
  3.	 Deliver valuable PMO services and improvements incrementally, from weekly updates to 
monthly enhancements, prioritizing shorter delivery cycles to enable rapid feedback and 
adaptation.
  4.	 Foster daily collaboration between the PMO team and PMO customers throughout the PMO 
initiatives. Break down silos and encourage cross-functional engagement.
  5.	 Build PMO services and initiatives around motivated, cross-functional teams. Provide the teams 
with the necessary resources, autonomy, and support, trusting them to deliver value and drive 
continuous improvement.
  6.	 Prioritize direct, real-time communication within the PMO and with PMO customers. While 
documentation is valuable, effective communication (face to face or virtual) is the most 
effective way of sharing information, aligning expectations, and resolving issues.
  7.	 Measure PMO success primarily through the tangible value delivered to the PMO’s customers 
and the organization. Focus on outcome-based metrics that demonstrate the PMO’s impact on 
business objectives and customer satisfaction.
  8.	 Promote sustainable operations through a balanced workload, continuous learning, and 
adaptable processes. The PMO should set a pace that allows for consistent value delivery while 
avoiding burnout and maintaining long-term effectiveness.
  9.	 Continuously enhance PMO services through technical excellence, process optimization, and 
innovative solutions. Regularly assess and upgrade the PMO’s services, tools, methodologies, 
and competencies to stay aligned with evolving organizational needs.
10.	 Embrace simplicity in PMO operations by focusing on high-value services and eliminating 
unnecessary complexity. Continuously refine processes, streamline governance, and prioritize 
efforts that directly contribute to organizational success.
11.	 Empower self-organizing teams within the PMO to design and evolve service offerings, 
methodologies, and practices. The most effective PMO structures, processes, and solutions 
emerge from teams that have the autonomy to innovate and adapt to changing organizational 
needs.
12.	 At regular intervals, the PMO conducts thorough self-assessments to evaluate its effectiveness, 
relevance, alignment with organizational goals, and overall value for its customers and the 
organization. Based on these reflections, the PMO continuously refines its strategies, services, 
and practices to enhance its value proposition and agility.

The PMO as a Value-Driven Service Provider  51
These adopted principles emphasize the PMO’s focus on delivering value, embracing change, 
fostering collaboration, and continuously improving its practices to better serve the organization.
Embracing these agile values and principles represents a significant shift for many PMOs. The 
shift requires moving away from a control-oriented mindset toward one that prioritizes flexibility, 
collaboration, and continuous value delivery. This move can be challenging, as it often involves 
unlearning deeply ingrained practices and ways of thinking. However, the potential benefits of this 
transformation are substantial. By adopting an agile mindset, PMOs can become more responsive 
to organizational needs, better equipped to handle uncertainty and change, and more effective in 
driving real business value. The PMO can move from being perceived as bureaucratic overhead to 
becoming a true strategic partner in organizational success.
It is important to note that embracing agility does not mean abandoning all structure or 
governance. Rather, it involves finding a balance between flexibility and control, and between 
responsiveness and consistency. The goal is to create a PMO that can provide the necessary 
structure and support while remaining adaptable and value-focused.
PMOs That Adapt and Thrive
Contrary to popular belief, agility in PMOs is not merely about adopting agile methodologies or 
tools. At its core, agility represents a profound shift in behavior and mindset. This distinction is 
crucial for understanding the true nature of what we might call an agility-driven PMO.
An agility-driven PMO is not defined by the services it offers but by how the PMO operates and 
adapts to the needs of its customers and the organization as a whole. It is entirely possible, and in 
many cases desirable, for a PMO to offer no services that involve traditional agile methodologies or 
tools. Services are simply the means to meet customer needs, and true agility lies in the ability to 
flexibly choose and adapt these means in a responsive manner.
Consider, for instance, an energy company with a portfolio of large capital projects. In this context, 
a predictive approach might be more suitable than an adaptive one. Conversely, in a technology 
company, more adaptive methods may be preferable. The key lies in the PMO’s ability to assess the 
context and choose the most appropriate approach, whether it is labeled “agile” or “traditional.”
One more example, now using an approach that categorizes problems based on their complexity 
and uncertainty: Consider a tech company with well-established, off-the-shelf products. Despite 
being in the IT sector, their projects might have low uncertainty, making a predictive approach more 
suitable. Conversely, large investment projects with uncertain outcomes, such as developing new 
energy solutions, might benefit from a hybrid approach. The PMO should assess the uncertainty 
level and choose the appropriate method, blending agile and traditional approaches as needed.
In many environments, a hybrid approach will make the most sense. This situation is particularly 
true for PMOs serving a variety of customers from different departments (e.g., IT and engineering) 
with specific needs and challenges. True agility manifests in the ability to navigate this spectrum of 
approaches, selecting and combining elements as needed to deliver maximum value.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
In practice, this might mean a PMO in a large manufacturing company using traditional, predictive 
methods for plant construction projects while simultaneously employing an agile approach for IT 
initiatives and a hybrid approach for product development. The agility lies not in the methods used 
but in the PMO’s ability to select, adapt, and switch between these approaches as needed, always 
with an eye on delivering maximum value to the organization.
The essence of agility in PMOs, therefore, lies in how the PMO behaves—striving to adhere to agile 
values and principles regardless of the specific solutions it uses to serve its customers. In other 
words, agility in PMOs is not about what the PMO does but how it does it and how it responds to 
the needs of its customers and the organization. True agility manifests in the ability to adapt and 
navigate across this spectrum of approaches, selecting and combining elements as needed to 
deliver maximum value.
This transformation allows PMOs to become more responsive to organizational needs, better 
equipped to handle uncertainty and change, and more effective in driving real business value. This 
shift enables PMOs to move from being perceived as bureaucratic overhead to becoming agile 
enablers of organizational success.
Implementing Agility in PMO Practice
Implementing agility in PMO practice involves several key steps and considerations to ensure a 
successful transformation. This process begins with developing an adaptive mindset that embraces 
change, values flexibility, and prioritizes continuous improvement.
Creating a responsive structure and implementing customer-centric practices are crucial for agility. 
The PMO should offer flexible services that adapt to changing organizational needs and leverage 
data for informed decision-making.
Leadership plays a vital role in driving and sustaining agility, while transparent communication 
and collaboration enhance the process. Lastly, fostering innovation and maintaining a focus on 
delivering value will help the PMO become a true agility-driven entity.
The key steps and considerations for implementing agility in PMO practice include the following:
•	 Develop an adaptive mindset. The foundation of an agility-driven PMO is a mindset that 
embraces change, values flexibility, and prioritizes continuous improvement.
•	 Create a responsive structure. The organizational structure of the PMO should support agility 
and quick decision-making.
•	 Implement customer-centric practices. Putting the PMO customer at the center of PMO 
operations is crucial for agility.
•	 Develop flexible service offerings. An agility-driven PMO should be able to quickly adapt its 
services to meet changing organizational needs.
•	 Embrace data-driven decision-making. Leveraging data is crucial for making informed, 
agile decisions.

The PMO as a Value-Driven Service Provider  53
•	 Promote decentralized management. An agility-driven PMO promotes shared management 
with project and product teams. This approach empowers teams to make decisions and adapt 
quickly to changes.
•	 Evaluate and navigate complexity. Continuously assess and manage project complexity to 
ensure that approaches and plans enable teams to successfully navigate the project life cycle.
•	 Foster adaptive leadership. PMO leaders play a crucial role in driving and sustaining agility.
•	 Enhance transparent communication. Open and clear communication is essential for an 
agility-driven PMO.
•	 Enhance collaboration and knowledge sharing. Agility thrives on effective collaboration and 
rapid knowledge dissemination.
•	 Foster innovation. An agility-driven PMO should be a catalyst for innovation.
Implementing these practices requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to learn and adapt. 
It is important to remember that becoming an agility-driven PMO is a journey, not a destination. 
Regular reflection, continuous improvement, and a relentless focus on delivering value should be at 
the heart of this transformation.
Agility in PMOs is an ongoing commitment to adaptation, improvement, and value delivery. This 
commitment requires not just new skills and practices but a fundamental shift in how the PMO 
views itself and its position within the organization.
This journey toward becoming an agility-driven PMO is about cultivating a mindset of flexibility, 
customer centricity, and continuous improvement. The shift toward agility is about being 
responsive to change, focused on value delivery, and committed to enabling organizational 
success.
Navigating the Challenges of Demonstrating PMO Value
Quantifying the value of a PMO is a multifaceted challenge. Unlike straightforward financial metrics, 
the value generated by a PMO often encompasses a range of intangible benefits that, while critical 
to organizational success, are difficult to measure and express in purely monetary terms.
Empirical attempts to demonstrate the monetary value of a PMO to an organization’s business 
have been ongoing. While academic initiatives have provided valuable insights into the PMO 
phenomenon, they have often presented inconclusive results when attempting to demonstrate the 
expected impact of a PMO on an organization’s business.
Research has shown that finding a universal model is challenging due to the many variables 
that can influence how a PMO generates an impact on the business. These variables include 
the organization’s culture, project management maturity, executive sponsorship, and, most 
importantly, the specific needs of each organization and how the PMO was set up to meet 
those needs.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
On the other hand, the recent experience of some of the most prominent and successful PMOs 
globally has shown that PMOs that do not consistently generate perceived value for their 
customers—no matter how well they excel at the technical quality of their work—are constantly 
challenged and questioned.
These PMOs face a constant risk of being discontinued. Just like a service provider that does not 
deliver the expected benefits, PMOs that cannot make customers realize the value they generate for 
the organization are at risk of becoming obsolete.
Value Is in the Eye of the Beholder
As beauty, value is in the eye of the beholder.  This phrase underscores a fundamental truth about 
PMO value: Success is not defined solely by the objective delivery of value but also by how this 
value is perceived by the PMO’s customers.
A PMO might implement the most efficient processes and deliver projects on time and within 
budget, but if stakeholders do not recognize and value these efforts, the PMO’s contributions may 
go unappreciated.
Each customer’s perception of value will differ based on their individual pain points and needs. 
Therefore, mapping these pains and needs is essential for the PMO to design solutions that 
effectively meet customer expectations.
The Journey of Value Generation
Value generation is a journey where each customer’s expectations evolve as their maturity increases. 
This dynamic process allows the PMO to construct a value journey for each customer, enabling 
continuous value delivery that meets evolving expectations and needs. PMO professionals should 
understand the importance of adapting and evolving alongside customers, ensuring that the PMO 
remains relevant and valuable over time.
A delivered value can be tangible or intangible, and both forms can be measured. Tangible values 
include cost savings, revenue increases, and efficiency gains. On the other hand, intangible values 
encompass improved communication, stakeholder satisfaction, and enhanced collaboration. Both 
types of value are critical and need to be recognized and measured to demonstrate the PMO’s 
impact effectively.
The Concept of Customer Perception of Value
The concept of  “customer perception of value” refers to the customer’s evaluation of the benefits 
they receive from a product or service in relation to the costs or sacrifices they make. This evaluation 
is subjective and varies based on individual preferences, experiences, and expectations. Based on 
extensive knowledge from other knowledge areas, the general concept of  “value perception”  has 
been adapted to the reality of PMOs.

The PMO as a Value-Driven Service Provider  55
The perception of value is a subjective feeling that reflects whether customer expectations have 
been met. While technical indicators are essential, they cannot fully reflect an organization’s 
perception of a PMO’s relevance to the business. However, it is possible to manage and measure 
how a PMO generates value perception for its customers, and the experiences of world-class PMOs 
indicate that a PMO’s ability to generate value perception is critical for its survival and continuity.
PMOs should focus on generating value perception and ensuring that customers recognize 
the value they bring to the organization to justify their existence and enable them to thrive. 
By focusing on delivering services and support that PMO customers perceive as valuable, a PMO 
can more effectively demonstrate its worth and contribute to the success of its customers and 
the organization.
The Influence of Maturity on Value Perception
The customer’s maturity significantly influences the perception of value in project management. 
Even when a PMO delivers substantial value, it may not be recognized by customers who lack the 
maturity to understand the importance of the outcomes generated.
To better understand this concept, consider the analogy of an adult and a child being offered a real 
Ferrari—the highly coveted car—or a remote-controlled Ferrari toy. With a mature understanding, 
the adult would choose the real Ferrari for its undeniable value. In contrast, the child might choose 
the toy as it meets their expectation of benefits and aligns with their limited understanding of the 
real Ferrari’s value.
In the real world, this situation might manifest in a scenario where high-level executives, despite 
being highly experienced and competent in their business areas, focus on tactical and operational 
aspects of project management rather than strategic ones. Their lower project management 
maturity may prevent the executives from fully appreciating the strategic value provided by 
the PMO.
Looking Ahead to the Next Section
With the PMO positioned as a value-driven service provider, it is clear how this approach can elevate 
PMOs into strategic assets for their organizations. Yet, to truly thrive in this capacity, PMOs should 
do more than offer services—they should adopt a customer-centric mindset. Shifting the focus from 
processes to people is the next pivotal step in the evolution of PMOs.
In the following section, the concept of PMO customer centricity and exploring how it can further 
boost the PMO’s ability to deliver value and contribute to organizational success will be explored. 
The strategies for understanding customer needs, customizing services, and fostering strong 
stakeholder relationships will also be explained. This customer-centric approach builds on the 
value-driven model, pushing PMO effectiveness to new levels.

Centricity
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
This section is critical for PMO professionals as it represents a paradigm shift in how PMOs operate 
and deliver value. The customer-centric approach transforms PMOs from process-oriented entities 
to strategic partners focused on meeting customer needs and expectations. This section provides 
the framework for this transformation, offering practical insights into understanding customer 
expectations, tailoring services, and measuring customer satisfaction.
The section also includes a list of 30 common, expected PMO outcomes drawn from extensive 
global research. With this customer-focused approach, PMO professionals can prioritize efforts, tailor 
services, and create tangible value, ultimately increasing the PMO’s impact and proving its worth to 
the organization.
Defining PMO Customers
At the heart of a modern PMO lies a clear understanding of who exactly qualifies as a PMO customer. 
In essence, PMO customers are stakeholders within an organization that directly receive, use, or 
benefit from the services provided by the PMO.
While the terms “customers” and “stakeholders” are sometimes used interchangeably in the context 
of PMOs, they represent distinct concepts that are crucial to understand.
•	 PMO customers. This grouping includes those stakeholders who directly receive and use PMO 
services. They have specific needs that the PMO aims to meet and can provide direct feedback 
on the value and quality of PMO offerings. The relationship is transactional and service oriented.
•	 Other PMO stakeholders. PMO stakeholders encompass a broader group, including anyone 
who has an interest in or is affected by the PMO’s activities, whether they directly use its services 
or not.
All PMO customers are stakeholders, but not all stakeholders are customers. For example, at a 
large retail chain undergoing a digital transformation, IT team leaders often utilize the PMO’s 
mentoring services, making them both direct customers and stakeholders of the PMO. In contrast, 
store managers across the country, while not direct customers since they don’t receive services

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
from the PMO, are still stakeholders because the transformation will significantly impact their store 
operations, making them indirectly affected by the outcomes of the PMO’s work.
The most frequent PMO customers can be broadly categorized into several groups (see Figure 6-1).
The common groups of PMO customers include:
•	 Project managers. Often the primary customers, project managers rely on the PMO for 
methodologies, tools, templates, and support in managing their projects.
•	 Program managers. Program managers depend on the PMO for program-level support, 
including resource allocation, interproject dependencies, and strategic alignment.

•	 Portfolio managers. These customers look to the PMO for portfolio-level insights, prioritization 
frameworks, and strategic decision-making support.
•	 Executives and senior management. Senior and executive-level management are customers 
who receive the PMO’s strategic insights, performance reports, and decision-support services.
•	 Project team members. Project professionals across the team use PMO-provided tools and 
processes in their day-to-day project work.
•	 Functional managers and teams. Other managers and team members in the organization rely 
on the PMO for coordination across different departments, resource management, and aligning 
project outcomes with functional objectives.
•	 External partners or clients. In some cases, external entities may be PMO customers if they 
directly benefit from or interact with PMO services.
To qualify as a PMO customer, an individual should have a direct interaction with or dependency on 
the PMO’s offerings. The key factor is that these customers have specific needs that the PMO aims to 
fulfill through its services.
Different customers have varying requirements—a project manager might need hands-on support 
with risk management practices, while the CEO might require high-level, strategic insights for 
decision-making.
By understanding these groups and their unique demands, PMOs can enhance their service delivery, 
providing tailored, value-added support that drives organizational success and delivers meaningful 
value.
Building a Customer-Centric PMO
The concept of customer centricity is very much in tune with the ethos of service providers such as 
a PMO because it recognizes that putting the customer at the center of operations is of paramount 
importance. This shift to customer centricity represents a fundamental change in how PMOs 
approach their strategies, processes, and overall performance. PMOs should now consider evolving 
customer needs and expectations; it is no longer possible to justify the PMO’s existence by focusing 
solely on methods, tools, or any other technical outputs it generates.
Customer centricity as a critical differentiator enables PMOs to create stronger relationships, foster 
commitment, and achieve sustainable growth. This positioning acknowledges that customers have 
substantial power in an age of abundant choices and information. Customers not only require 
quality services but also want exceptional experiences and meaningful interactions at every 
touchpoint with the PMO.
Being customer centric is particularly important for PMOs. As internal service providers, PMOs 
should align their value proposition with the needs of their organizational customers, thus ensuring 
that project management practices deliver business value directly. By adopting a customer-centric 
approach, PMOs can cease being mere administrative entities and turn into strategic partners, 
pushing for organizational success.

Customer centricity refers to being strategic in approaching businesses’ decisions, operations, and 
interactions, placing customers at their core. This philosophy prioritizes understanding, anticipating, 
and fulfilling customer needs to create long-term value and satisfaction.
At the heart of customer centricity is an understanding that the PMO’s role is to serve its 
customers—the various persons who depend on PMO services. This change in perspective turns the 
usual idea of a PMO as a process-oriented, administrative entity into one that contributes value and 
becomes a partner in organizational success.
Principles of a Customer-Centric PMO
Adopting a customer-centric approach within a PMO requires adherence to several key principles 
that ensure the PMO remains focused on delivering value and meeting the needs of its customers. 
The fundamental principles of a customer-centric PMO are illustrated in Figure 6-2.
The principles of customer-centric PMOs include the following:
•	 Customer-first mindset. All decisions, processes, and services should be assessed based on how 
they meet the customers’ needs. This mentality helps ensure that every action taken by the PMO 
is aligned with the goal of enhancing customer satisfaction and delivering tangible benefits. By 
prioritizing customer needs, the PMO can build trust and foster long-term relationships.
•	 Value delivery. The focus should be on delivering value to PMO customers rather than just 
enforcing procedures or methodologies. Value delivery involves understanding what constitutes 
value for different customers and ensuring that PMO activities contribute to achieving the most 
relevant outcomes, whether they are strategic, tactical, or operational.

Embracing PMO Customer Centricity  61
•	 Customized experiences. Services and interactions should be adapted according to PMO 
customers’ needs, culture, and maturity level. This customization requires a deep understanding 
of the customer landscape, including their specific challenges, preferences, and expectations. By 
providing personalized services, the PMO can enhance its effectiveness and relevance.
•	 Proactive interaction. The PMO should actively seek out customer concerns rather than waiting 
for them to be raised, helping to ensure satisfactory results. Proactive interaction involves 
regularly engaging with customers to identify potential issues early and address them promptly. 
This approach helps build a responsive and agile PMO that can quickly adapt to changing 
customer needs.
•	 Customer success and satisfaction measurement. Define and track metrics that reflect PMO 
customer success, satisfaction, commitment, and advocacy. These metrics provide valuable 
insights into how well the PMO meets customer expectations and where improvements are 
needed. Regular measurement and analysis of these metrics can help in maintaining a customer-
centric focus and driving continuous improvement.
•	 Constant feedback loops and continuous improvement. Regularly gather feedback from PMO 
customers to improve customer touchpoints and service outcomes continuously. Feedback is a 
critical component of a customer-centric approach as it provides direct input from the customers 
about their experiences and needs. By establishing a continuous feedback loop, the PMO can 
ensure that it remains aligned with customer expectations and adapts its services accordingly.
Identifying PMO Customers’ Expectations
Understanding PMO customers’ expectations is paramount to a PMO’s success and relevance. These 
expectations represent the potential outcomes that customers anticipate from the PMO and its 
offered services. By gaining deep insight into these needs, the PMO can tailor its strategies and 
services to align closely with what truly matters to its customers.
PMO customers should articulate their needs to the PMO in terms of benefits and outcomes rather 
than technical functions, services, or outputs. Their primary concern is achieving effective results 
that address practical challenges in their daily work. By focusing on desired outcomes, customers 
enable the PMO to better understand the actual value they seek, allowing for more targeted and 
impactful solutions.
This outcome-oriented communication fosters a more substantial alignment between the PMO’s 
offerings and the customers’ actual needs, ultimately leading to higher satisfaction and more 
meaningful contributions to organizational success.
For instance, an executive is primarily interested in having reliable, comprehensive information 
readily available for decision-making—an outcome that enhances their ability to lead effectively. 
This desired result is more important to them than the processes, specific reports, or data analysis 
tools the PMO might use to deliver this information. Similarly, a project manager’s primary concern 
is not the project management methodology but rather the results it enables—more efficient, cost-
effective, and predictable projects.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
By proactively seeking to understand and address these outcome-focused expectations, the PMO 
can tailor its services to truly align with customer needs and add meaningful value to its work. This 
customer-centric approach enables the PMO to anticipate requirements, offer relevant solutions, 
and consistently deliver impactful results that resonate with its customers’ objectives.
To illustrate this concept, consider the analogy of a physician treating patients with various types 
of pain. Patients expect the doctor to alleviate their pain and cure them. If these expectations are 
met, the value of the physician’s work is recognized. Just as different types of pain require specific 
treatments, different PMO customers have distinct needs that should be addressed with tailored 
services.
In the PMO world, every “pain” requires a specific “medicine,” meaning that each challenge or desired 
outcome aligns with a tailored PMO service. Just as a doctor prescribes treatment to address a 
patient’s symptoms, the PMO offers services designed to tackle specific organizational needs. For 
example, when there is a “pain” of lacking strategic alignment, the “medicine” might be portfolio 
management support to better connect the projects with strategic goals. In another case, if the 
challenge is inconsistent information for decision-making, the PMO could implement integrated 
systems and project status reporting to deliver reliable insights. Similarly, if the aim is to increase 
team motivation, the PMO might “prescribe” training or mentoring services. This approach ensures 
that every customer and organizational need is matched with a targeted solution.
When collecting PMO customers’ expectations initially, it might seem logical to present customers 
with a “menu” of potential PMO services and ask them to select their preferences. However, this 
approach is fundamentally flawed. The crux of the issue lies in the disparity between the technical 
language of PMO services and the outcome-oriented language of PMO customers.
Asking PMO customers to choose from a list of services is akin to a doctor asking patients to select 
their preferred medicines. Customers, like patients, are typically not experts in the matter and 
cannot make informed decisions about which services best meet their needs. The solution lies in 
communicating with PMO customers using outcome-oriented language.
By asking each customer to select and prioritize the outcomes they value most, the PMO can 
identify the priorities it should focus on delivering. For instance, if a priority outcome is “more 
availability of resources with skills in project management,” it becomes evident that “provide training 
and project competency development” is more likely to generate this outcome than “monitoring 
and controlling programs or projects.” Assessing how well each service can generate each outcome 
allows the PMO to identify the most critical services to deliver the expected results.
Understanding and meeting PMO customer expectations is fundamental to creating a PMO that 
consistently generates value. By focusing on benefits and communicating in a customer-centric 
language, PMOs can align their services with customer needs, fostering engagement, continuous 
improvement, and strategic alignment. This approach enhances the PMO’s impact and ensures its 
long-term relevance and success within the organization.

The 30 Potential PMO Outcomes
Building on the customer-centric approach, this section presents a powerful resource for PMO 
professionals: a curated list of 30 potential PMO outcomes. This comprehensive list has emerged 
from extensive research within the global PMO community, encompassing PMOs from diverse 
regions and industries. The insights gathered represent a broad spectrum of experiences, 
challenges, and good practices observed across various organizational contexts.
The outcomes listed have been distilled from interactions with PMO leaders, project 
managers, and stakeholders from multinational corporations, government agencies, nonprofit 
organizations, and small- to medium-sized enterprises. This diverse sample ensures that the list 
captures a wide range of potential needs and pain points that PMOs might encounter, regardless 
of their specific industry or geographical location. The 30 potential outcomes of a PMO are 
detailed in Table 6-1.
The PMO Customer Expectation Assessment, found in Appendix X2 of this guide, is a valuable tool 
for PMO professionals. For each of the 30 outcomes, it features “Evidence of Need,” which highlights 
signs that a customer may face challenges in a specific area; “How to Question the Customer,” which 
offers conversation starters to explore needs and expectations; and “Recommended Services,” 
which lists common PMO services that could address the specific outcome. This assessment helps 
PMOs to determine needs systematically, prioritize services based on customer requirements, make 
informed decisions about resource allocation, and create a strategic, customer-centric approach to 
PMO operations.
Benefits of a Customer-Centric PMO
Transforming a traditional PMO into a customer-centric one can significantly enhance its 
relevance and effectiveness within an organization. Some typical advantages associated with this 
transformation include:
•
Added value creation. When PMO services align with customers’ needs, then value-chain
activities become more visible on both sides. This alignment helps ensure that the PMO
contributes directly to the achievement of organizational goals and delivers outcomes that
are meaningful to its customers. As a result, the PMO is seen as a valuable partner in the
organization’s success.
Example: At a global manufacturing company, executives struggled to see the connection 
between strategies and projects. The PMO introduced a comprehensive portfolio management 
process that visually mapped projects to strategic objectives. This initiative allowed executives to 
clearly perceive the value of ongoing projects, leading to more informed decision-making and a 
25% increase in strategically aligned projects within 6 months.

Embracing PMO Customer Centricity  69
•	 Enhanced PMO customer relationships. Emphasizing customer success and satisfaction 
leads to closer, more positive ties across the entire organization. Strong customer relationships 
are built on trust, communication, and a shared commitment to achieving project goals. By 
focusing on customer needs, the PMO can build stronger, more collaborative relationships with 
stakeholders.
Example: A technology firm’s PMO established a mentorship program for inexperienced project 
managers. By providing one-on-one guidance, regular check-ins, and tailored advice, the PMO 
developed strong, trust-based relationships with the project managers. As a result, project 
success rates improved by 40% over a year, and the PMO became known as a trusted partner in 
professional development.
•	 Flexible responses. Ongoing feedback from PMO customers allows the PMO to respond quickly 
to changing specific contexts. Flexibility is crucial in a dynamic business environment where 
customer needs and project requirements can evolve quickly. A customer-centric PMO is better 
equipped to adapt to these changes and provide timely, effective support.
Example: A diversified conglomerate’s PMO noticed that its IT and construction divisions had vastly 
different project management needs. In response, they developed two distinct methodologies: 
an agile-based approach for the fast-paced IT division and a more traditional waterfall method for 
the construction unit. This tailored approach led to a 60% increase in methodology adoption rates 
across both divisions within 3 months.
•	 Better strategic fit. The PMO understands customer needs so that its services can effectively 
align with general organizational strategy. Aligning PMO services with organizational strategy 
helps ensure that the PMO contributes to the achievement of strategic objectives and provides 
value that supports the overall direction of the organization.
Example: Anticipating the organization’s impending digital transformation efforts, a retail 
company’s PMO proactively launched an extensive project management competency 
development program. When the transformation initiative was officially announced 6 months 
later, the organization already had a pool of more than 100 trained professionals ready to lead 
critical projects.
•	 Increased PMO relevance. To help ensure that such a unit is needed and accountable in 
the organization, the PMO should take a customer-focused standpoint. A customer-centric 
PMO demonstrates its value through its ability to meet customer needs, solve problems, and 
deliver successful project outcomes. This relevance helps secure the PMO’s position within the 
organization and justify its existence.
Example: A financial services firm’s PMO conducted a comprehensive review of its services 
and tools. The PMO identified several practices and tools that were no longer justified by their 
customers’ actual needs. The PMO sunsetted these outdated services and tools and redirected 
efforts to develop new services to address emerging customer needs. This proactive approach 
not only saved the company US$500,000 annually but also positioned the PMO as an innovative, 
forward-thinking unit essential to the organization’s future success.

In short, a customer-centric PMO represents an evolution of PMO practices. Integrating 
operations with an organization’s actual needs significantly improves value. By doing this, PMOs 
can create more value, deliver better project results, and position themselves as critical to their 
organization’s success.
Looking Ahead to the Next Section
Having explored the concept of PMO customer centricity, it is clear how this approach can greatly 
enhance a PMO’s effectiveness and add value to the organization. To fully unlock this potential, 
however, PMOs should have a deep understanding of the services they provide and how these 
offerings evolve over time.
The following section explores PMO services and maturity, covering a wide range of services—from 
strategic guidance to operational support. The section describes how these services mature and 
adapt, enabling PMOs to consistently improve their value proposition. By mastering service delivery 
and maturity, PMO professionals can be better equipped to implement customer-centric strategies 
that meet and exceed expectations at every stage.

PMO Services and PMO Maturity
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
This section provides PMO professionals with a comprehensive list of the 26 most common PMO 
services, based on research from the global PMO community. The section offers a detailed overview 
of strategic, tactical, and operational services widely implemented across various organizations.
Additionally, it introduces a valuable model that highlights different approaches for delivering these 
services to PMO customers, moving beyond the traditional, one-size-fits-all categorization. This 
flexible framework enables more nuanced and adaptable service delivery. The section also clarifies 
what PMO maturity truly means and presents a model for evaluating the maturity of PMO services.
By exploring this range of services, delivery methods, and the concept of service maturity, 
PMO professionals can gain insights into how to tailor their offerings to meet the unique needs of 
their organization.
From PMO Functions to PMO Services
PMOs should evolve from functional units into strategic service providers within their organizations. 
This shift reflects a deeper understanding of how PMOs can drive value and contribute to 
organizational success in today’s complex business landscape.
At their core, PMOs serve as central hubs for portfolio, program, and project management expertise. 
A PMO offers a comprehensive suite of services designed to enhance capabilities and drive 
organizational success. These offerings are not static; they evolve as the organization’s goals change, 
PMO customers’ requirements arise, and the PMO itself matures.
The transition from viewing PMO activities as “functions” to “services” represents a fundamental 
change in organizational mindset. This customer-centric approach positions the PMO as a value 
provider, focusing on meeting its customers’ needs. By framing their offerings as services, PMOs can 
more clearly articulate their value proposition and align with organizational needs.
This service-oriented approach offers several advantages. A focus on service allows for 
greater flexibility and adaptability, enabling PMOs to adjust their offerings based on changing 
organizational needs. Services are typically easier to define, measure, and evaluate, facilitating 
performance tracking and continuous improvement efforts.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
Moreover, the service model encourages more active customer engagement, creating a two-way 
relationship rather than a top-down, functional approach. The service mindset fosters a value-driven 
mentality, where the PMO should clearly demonstrate its value to the organization. This perspective 
professionalizes the PMO role, positioning it as a strategic partner rather than just an administrative 
function.
The service approach also allows for customization, enabling PMOs to tailor their offerings to meet 
the diverse needs of different customers, departments, or business units. The approach often comes 
with clearer expectations and service-level agreements, increasing accountability and leading to 
improved service quality and stakeholder satisfaction.
By embracing this service-oriented mindset, PMOs can transform from static, process-oriented entities 
into proactive, value-generating partners in organizational success. This evolution positions the PMO to 
play a more strategic role, directly contributing to organizational agility, efficiency, and overall success.
In essence, PMO services are designed to enhance project management maturity, drive strategic 
alignment, and ultimately contribute to the achievement of organizational goals. Understanding 
and leveraging these diverse services is essential for both PMO professionals and organizational 
leaders seeking to maximize the value of their project management initiatives in an increasingly 
complex business environment.
Service Categories and Domains
PMO services encompass a wide range of functions designed to support and enhance portfolio, 
program, and project management within an organization. These services are integral to ensuring 
that projects are executed efficiently, strategically aligned with organizational goals, and deliver 
maximum value.
These PMO services can be classified into three main categories: strategic, tactical, and operational, 
as detailed in Table 7-1.
Additionally, these services can be applied across the three different domains. By tailoring PMO 
services to these domains, organizations can effectively address their distinct needs:
•	 Portfolio. This domain encompasses the strategic management of all programs and projects 
within an organization. PMO services in this domain include portfolio planning, prioritization, 
performance measurement, and alignment with organizational strategy. This ensures that the 
portfolio delivers maximum value and supports the organization’s overall objectives.
•	 Program. This domain involves the coordinated management of multiple related projects that 
are aligned to achieve a common goal. PMO services here include program governance, resource 
allocation, risk management, and benefits realization, ensuring that all projects within the 
program deliver their intended benefits.
•	 Project. This domain focuses on the management of individual projects, ensuring that each 
project is completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards. PMO services 
in this domain include project planning, execution, monitoring, and closure.

PMO Service Approaches
The concept of PMO service approaches represents a significant evolution in how PMOs operate 
and deliver value within organizations. This shift moves away from traditional, rigid service models 
toward a more dynamic and flexible approach that enables PMOs to better meet the evolving needs 
and expectations of their diverse customer base.
Traditionally, PMOs were often categorized into fixed types such as consultative, directive, 
supportive, or controlling, with the assumption that a PMO would operate uniformly regardless 
of its customers or the services provided. However, this one-size-fits-all approach has proven to 
inadequately represent the reality observed in PMOs across various organizations worldwide.

PMO Customer Maturity
Low
High
In fact, the reality within organizations is far more nuanced. Depending on the characteristics 
of the customers, such as their project management maturity level and the specific services 
being provided, different approaches can and should be utilized. This realization has led to the 
development of a more flexible, customer-centric model of PMO service delivery.
Tailoring Approaches to Customer Needs
A key insight in this new paradigm is that a PMO might offer the same service to two different 
customers using distinct approaches. For example, the PMO could adopt a consultative manner 
for one customer while taking a more controlling approach for another. This decision is typically 
influenced by the maturity level of each customer in terms of project management capabilities.
Consider a scenario where a PMO is providing services to both the IT and finance departments of 
an organization. The IT department, being more frequently involved in projects, is likely to have a 
higher project management maturity level. In contrast, the finance department, which is primarily 
process-oriented, might have a lower maturity level in project management. Consequently, the PMO 
might provide the same service to both departments but with different approaches, offering more 
autonomy to IT and less to finance.
This customer-centered approach recognizes that different departments or teams within an 
organization can have vastly different experiences with—and capabilities in—project management. 
By tailoring the approach to the specific needs and maturity levels of different customers, the PMO 
can provide the right balance of support and autonomy, enhancing its effectiveness and value to 
the organization. The different approaches allow PMOs to gradually increase the autonomy given to 
customers as their capabilities and maturity grow. The primary approaches a PMO might use for a 
specific service are shown in Figure 7-1.
The primary approaches include:
•	 Consultative approach. In this approach, the PMO acts as an advisor, providing expert advice 
and recommendations. The customers maintain full control over portfolios, programs, and 
projects, making their own decisions based on the guidance received. This approach is often 
suitable for mature customers with solid capabilities and maturity.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
•	 Supportive approach. In this approach, the PMO offers practical assistance, tools, and resources 
to help customers execute their responsibilities more effectively. While the PMO facilitates and 
supports, the customers retain significant control and autonomy over portfolios, programs, and 
projects. This approach can be effective for customers with moderate capabilities and maturity.
•	 Facilitative approach. This approach involves the PMO facilitating activities with customers 
through collaborative sessions. Customers have a high level of involvement and ownership with 
the PMO, creating an environment conducive to achieving shared goals related to portfolios, 
programs, and projects. This approach can be particularly useful in cross-functional scenarios 
where customers have moderate capabilities and maturity.
•	 Directive approach. In this approach, the PMO implements standardized processes and 
provides clear guidelines for executing specific tasks. While customers follow the established 
processes, they have less control over how tasks are executed, as the PMO dictates the processes 
related to portfolios, programs, and projects. This approach might be necessary for customers 
with low capabilities and maturity.
•	 Controlling approach. In this approach, the PMO oversees and regulates processes under the 
customer’s responsibility, maintaining control over portfolios, programs, and projects. The PMO 
has the authority to make decisions and implement actions, significantly reducing customer 
autonomy. This approach might be used in high-risk projects or with customers with very low 
capabilities and maturity.
•	 Managed approach. This is the most hands-on approach, where the PMO takes full 
responsibility for managing specific portfolio, program, or project activities for the organization 
or its customers. The PMO actively manages activities, leaving customers with minimal control 
over execution. This approach might be used for strategic, organization-wide initiatives or in 
cases where the customer lacks the capacity to manage the initiatives or activities effectively.
It is important to note that some PMO services may not encompass all of the approaches and may 
be restricted to only a few of them.
Choosing the Right Approach
The choice of service approach may depend on several factors, including the organization’s culture, 
the level of the customer’s project management maturity, available resources, and the nature of the 
projects being managed.
PMOs may also adopt a hybrid model, combining elements of different approaches to best meet the 
organization’s needs. For example, an organization might use a managed approach for core strategic 
projects. Alternatively, a PMO might adopt a supportive approach for most projects but take on a 
directive role for high-priority initiatives requiring strict standards adherence.
Ultimately, the goal of these various approaches is to enhance project management effectiveness, 
align project outcomes with organizational objectives, and deliver value to the organization. The key 
to successful implementation lies in clarity and consistency in how the chosen approach is applied 
and understood within the organization.

By tailoring the approach to the organization’s specific needs and context, PMOs can ensure they 
provide the most effective support for project success. Flexibility and adaptability are essential, 
allowing the PMO to evolve and adjust its strategies as organizational needs change over time.
This adaptive strategy allows PMOs to meet customers where they are in terms of project management 
maturity, providing the right level of support to drive continuous improvement and success.

By aligning these services with the most suitable approaches, the PMO can effectively meet each 
service’s specific needs and challenges, ensuring maximum impact and relevance within the 
organization.
The service approaches presented in this section revolutionize our understanding of PMOs, 
definitively dispelling the outdated notion that PMOs can be rigidly classified into simplistic 
categories such as directive PMO, controlling PMO, or supportive PMO. This evolution in thinking is 
based on observations of successful PMOs worldwide, revealing that the reality is far more nuanced 
and complex than these rigid classifications suggest.
In practice, high-performing PMOs demonstrate a remarkable ability to adapt their approaches 
dynamically, often employing different strategies simultaneously across various services and 
customers within the same organization. This flexibility allows PMOs to tailor their support to the 
specific needs, maturity levels, and contexts of each customer, maximizing the value they deliver.
For instance, a PMO might adopt a consultative approach when working with a highly mature IT 
department on strategic planning, while taking a more directive stance with a less experienced 
marketing team on project execution. Simultaneously, it could provide supportive services 
to the finance department for resource management. This adaptability enables the PMO to 
meet each customer’s unique needs effectively, fostering growth and success across the entire 
organization.
Moreover, this flexible approach allows PMOs to evolve their services over time, gradually shifting 
from more hands-on, controlling approaches to more consultative ones as their customers’

capabilities mature. This evolution helps ensure that the PMO continues to add value, even as the 
organization’s needs change.
In essence, the modern PMO is not defined by a single approach but by its ability to seamlessly 
transition among multiple approaches, always with the goal of delivering maximum value. This 
sophisticated understanding of PMO capabilities opens up new possibilities for how these entities 
can drive organizational success, foster innovation, and support strategic objectives across all levels 
of project management maturity.
As PMO professionals internalize this more nuanced perspective, they can develop more 
comprehensive, flexible, and impactful service offerings. This approach not only enhances the PMO’s 
ability to meet current organizational needs but also positions it to adapt and thrive in the face of 
future challenges and opportunities.
Understanding PMO Service Maturity
Project management maturity has long been a focus for organizations aiming to enhance their 
project delivery capabilities. While organizational project management maturity is a well-established 
concept, there is growing recognition that PMO maturity is a distinct and equally crucial aspect.
PMO maturity refers to the sophistication and effectiveness with which a PMO delivers its services 
and contributes to organizational success. Unlike organizational project management maturity, 
which assesses an organization’s overall portfolio, program, and project management capabilities, 
PMO maturity specifically examines the PMO’s evolution and performance.
The Cambridge Dictionary defines maturity as “a very advanced or developed form or state.” In the 
context of PMOs, this concept encompasses the progressive development of the PMO’s practices, 
capabilities, and ability to deliver value to the organization.
Traditionally, many organizational maturity models have oversimplified PMO effectiveness by 
treating the mere existence of a PMO as a marker of maturity. This approach fails to account for the 
varying levels of development and effectiveness that PMOs can exhibit, creating a significant gap in 
understanding and assessing PMO performance.
Furthermore, the idea of a standardized “mature PMO” model is problematic. PMOs should be 
adaptable to meet their organizations’ unique needs and expectations, making this standardization 
counterproductive. The key to PMO success lies in tailoring approaches and services to specific 
organizational contexts.
The concept of PMO service maturity represents a significant evolution in the understanding 
of how PMOs contribute to organizational success. By focusing on the sophistication of service 
delivery rather than adherence to a predefined model, this approach allows for a more nuanced and 
effective assessment of PMO performance.
The PMO service maturity model recognizes that two PMOs can provide the same service with vastly 
different levels of sophistication and potential value generation. The focus shifts from what services 
a PMO performs to how effectively it performs them.

This perspective challenges two common myths about PMO maturity:
•	 A strategic PMO is a mature PMO. This myth ignores that maturity is about service delivery 
effectiveness, not the type of services provided. Even a PMO offering only strategic services can 
have low maturity if it does not deliver those services effectively.
•	 A PMO should evolve from an operational to a strategic approach. A PMO’s evolution does 
not necessarily follow this path. The PMO’s approach should be defined by customer needs and 
expectations, not a predetermined evolutionary path.
A critical aspect of a PMO is aligning services with customer needs and expectations. Peter Drucker’s 
famous quote, “There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all,” 
perfectly encapsulates this critical aspect of PMO maturity. A PMO might excel in delivering a wide 
array of services with great efficiency, but if these services do not address the organization’s actual 
needs, they add little value.
For a PMO, being strategic, tactical, or operational is not an objective in itself but a consequence of 
meeting customers’ needs. A mature PMO not only performs its chosen services well but also selects 
services that deliver value in its specific organizational context.
The goal is not necessarily to reach the highest service maturity level in all dimensions—strategic, 
tactical, and operational. Instead, the focus should be on achieving the right level of service maturity 
to effectively support the organization’s needs and strategic objectives.
Therefore, it is essential to understand that PMO service maturity alone does not equate to success. 
While a higher level of service sophistication can indeed increase the likelihood of delivering the 
desired outcomes, it is equally vital for the PMO to ensure that its services are genuinely aligned 
with the needs of its customers and the organization. In other words, a high level of maturity 
without proper alignment to real needs will fail to generate a perception of value, ultimately leading 
to a waste of resources, efforts, and funds. This misalignment will inevitably result in the decline of 
the PMO, even if it provides technically flawless services. Success is achieved not by maturity alone 
but by delivering value that resonates with and meets the PMO customers’ and organization’s true 
priorities.
Appendix X3 in this guide offers a PMO Service Maturity Assessment—a comprehensive model for 
evaluating the maturity of the 26 most common PMO services. This assessment provides:
•	 A structured approach to measure the current maturity level of PMO services;
•	 Identified strengths and areas for improvement in PMO services;
•	 Assistance in establishing benchmarks and goals for PMO development; and
•	 Guidance on enhancing PMO services.

Developing Competencies 
for PMOs
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
Understanding how to develop competencies is crucial for PMO professionals seeking to 
enhance their effectiveness and strategic value within their organizations. This section provides 
a comprehensive roadmap for continuous professional growth, emphasizing the importance of 
ongoing skill development in the dynamic field of portfolio, program, and project management.
This section empowers PMO professionals to take charge of their career progression by outlining a 
structured approach to competency development. The section offers a systematic method for self-
assessment, gap analysis, and targeted improvement, enabling practitioners to align their skills with 
current job requirements and future career aspirations.
Ultimately, this comprehensive approach to competency development equips PMO professionals 
with the tools and mindset needed to excel in their roles, adapt to change, and position themselves 
as indispensable assets within their organizations. This approach reinforces the critical role of 
continuous learning in maintaining the PMO’s strategic relevance and impact.
Core competencies are the foundation of PMO professionalism. These competencies encompass 
a range of skills, including communication, leadership, analytical thinking, and stakeholder 
engagement. Every PMO professional should excel in these areas to ensure overall PMO 
effectiveness. However, it is important to note that certain specialized competencies may be 
required depending on the specific services the PMO provides. These targeted competencies enable 
professionals to develop expertise in their roles and contribute meaningfully to the PMO’s success.
The required proficiency levels for core competencies can vary significantly. Factors influencing this 
include the complexity of PMO services, organizational maturity, and, most importantly, the service-
level agreements (SLAs) established with PMO customers. Higher expectations and goals often 
necessitate more advanced competencies to enable the PMO to deliver superior outcomes.
When PMO professionals lack the necessary skills and knowledge, it can lead to inefficiencies, errors, 
and missed opportunities. This impacts immediate deliverables and can erode the PMO’s credibility 
within the organization.
To help ensure consistent value delivery, PMOs should prioritize their ongoing competency 
development. This effort involves regularly assessing PMO team competencies, identifying gaps, 
and implementing targeted training programs. This competency development work also requires

Exploring PMO Competency Domains
PMO competency domains encompass the various areas of responsibility that PMO professionals 
engage in while working within a PMO. These domains categorize the specialized expertise required 
depending on the PMO professional’s role, shaping their approach to delivering effective services 
aligned with organizational needs.
The three primary PMO competency domains are design, operation, and improvement. 
Each domain represents a fundamental aspect of PMO management, outlining the skills and 
responsibilities professionals should master to ensure effective service delivery and maximize value 
(see Figure 8-1).
The features of each competency domain are as follows:
•	 Design. This domain focuses on the design and development of PMO services. The domain 
is essential for establishing a solid foundation for service delivery, ensuring that services are 
strategically aligned and effectively meet stakeholder needs.
•	 Operation. This domain involves the day-to-day management and execution of PMO services. 
The domain focuses on delivering services according to the established plans, ensuring 
consistency, efficiency, quality, and value delivery.
•	 Improvement. This domain focuses on refining and optimizing PMO services to enhance their 
efficiency, effectiveness, and value delivery. The domain involves analyzing performance data, 
gathering feedback, and implementing actions to ensure continuous improvement.

Developing Competencies for PMOs  91
The PMO competency domains offer a structured approach to understanding and developing 
the diverse competencies required in a PMO. By categorizing expertise into design, operation, 
and improvement domains, this model provides PMO professionals with a clear path for skill 
development and career growth.
This three-domain structure allows PMO professionals to focus their skill development on specific 
areas of service expertise. The model also provides a framework for PMO leaders to ensure their 
teams possess a balanced mix of competencies, covering all aspects of service management from 
conception to optimization.
By embracing this approach, PMOs can ensure their services are well-designed, efficiently delivered, 
and continuously refined. This systematic development of competencies across all domains fosters 
an adaptable, effective PMO that is strategically aligned with organizational goals.
The PMO competency domains are a valuable tool for individual professional development and 
organizational capability building. The model empowers PMOs to deliver consistent value, drive 
strategic initiatives, and solidify their position as crucial contributors to organizational success.
The 30 core competencies for PMO professionals, along with real-world examples of their 
application in the three competency domains, are detailed in Table 8-1.
Aligning Core Competencies With PMO Services
The PMO’s effectiveness is not solely a function of the services it provides but is deeply rooted in 
the competencies of its professionals. While possessing a diverse set of skills is advantageous, it 
is essential to recognize that certain competencies are more critical than others when it comes 
to delivering specific PMO services effectively. This nuanced understanding of competency 
importance enables PMO professionals to focus their development efforts on the skills that will most 
significantly enhance their performance and the value they deliver to the organization.
The alignment between core competencies and PMO services is a strategic approach that maximizes 
both individual and organizational effectiveness. By identifying which competencies are paramount 
for each service, PMO professionals can tailor their skill development to meet the precise demands 
of their roles.
For instance, strategic services such as providing advice to executive leadership or supporting 
strategic planning require competencies like business acumen, strategic thinking, and strategic 
influence. Professionals excelling in these areas can better understand the organization’s vision, 
align projects and programs with long-term goals, and influence decision-making processes at the 
highest levels. Their ability to communicate effectively and lead with integrity further enhances their 
impact, ensuring that the PMO is seen as a valuable strategic partner within the organization.
Tactical services, including knowledge management and training and development, benefit 
significantly from competencies like collaboration, training skills, and continuous improvement. 
Professionals with strengths in these areas can effectively disseminate knowledge, foster a culture 
of learning, and enhance team capabilities, all of which contribute to the organization’s adaptability 
and innovation.

Conversely, operational services like audit assessments and quality assurance demand a different 
set of competencies, including attention to detail and objectivity. These competencies are crucial 
for delivering unbiased evaluations that can lead to process improvements and risk mitigation. 
Professionals who excel in these competencies help maintain the organization’s credibility and 
operational excellence.
Understanding this alignment is not just about improving individual performance; it also has 
profound implications for team dynamics and resource allocation within the PMO. By mapping 
competencies to services, leaders can assemble teams where each member’s strengths are optimally 
utilized, leading to more cohesive and high-performing units. This strategic deployment of human 
resources helps ensure that programs and projects receive the expertise they need, when they need 
it, thereby enhancing overall project success rates and value delivery.
The Critical Competency Profiles for PMO Service Delivery, which provides an in-depth analysis of 
essential competencies for effective PMO service delivery, can be found in Appendix X4. The profiles 
outline the competencies identified as critical for each of the 26 most common PMO services, along 
with explanations of their significance for successful execution.
How to Develop Competencies for PMO Professionals
Recognizing the critical importance of continuous professional development, forward-thinking 
PMO professionals understand that staying ahead of the curve is not just beneficial—it is essential. 
By cultivating a robust set of core competencies and specialized skills, PMO professionals can

elevate their performance, enhance the PMO’s value proposition, and ultimately contribute to the 
organization’s strategic objectives.
This guide outlines a comprehensive approach to competency development for PMO professionals, 
offering a roadmap for self-assessment, targeted improvement, and ongoing growth. By following 
these steps, PMO professionals can embark on a journey of continuous learning and adaptation, 
ensuring they remain at the forefront of project management excellence.
For PMO professionals aiming to enhance their capabilities or develop their teams, consider the 
following comprehensive approach:
•	 Conduct a thorough assessment of current competencies. Evaluate skills against both core 
PMO requirements and service-specific needs. Use standardized assessment tools and seek input 
from peers and supervisors.
•	 Identify competency gaps and prioritize areas for improvement. Analyze assessment results 
to pinpoint competency deficiencies. Align improvement priorities with organizational goals and 
PMO strategic objectives.
•	 Develop a personalized development plan. Create a detailed development plan with specific, 
measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. Include both short-term and 
long-term objectives to ensure continuous progress.
•	 Pursue diverse learning opportunities. Engage in formal training programs and pursue 
relevant certifications. Seek hands-on experience through challenging assignments and cross-
functional projects. Attend industry workshops and seminars to learn from experts and peers.
•	 Continuously gather and act on feedback. Implement a structured feedback system involving 
colleagues, customers, and mentors. Conduct regular self-reflection exercises to assess progress 
and adjust development plans. Use 360-degree feedback mechanisms to gain a comprehensive 
view of performance.
Consider implementing a formal PMO talent management program to maximize the impact 
of competency development efforts. This program should align individual growth plans with 
organizational objectives, provide resources for skill development, and create opportunities for 
knowledge sharing within the PMO community.
PMO professionals can significantly enhance their ability to deliver value by focusing on core and 
specialized competencies. This holistic approach ensures the achievement of promised outcomes 
and positions the PMO as a strategic asset capable of driving organizational success and meeting 
evolving customer needs.
Remember, competency development is an ongoing journey that requires dedication and 
adaptability. As the business landscape evolves, so should the skills of PMO professionals. By staying 
committed to continuous improvement and embracing a growth mindset, PMO professionals can 
help ensure they remain effective, relevant, and indispensable to their organizations.

Framework Overview
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
This section introduces a comprehensive framework that transforms PMOs from tactical overseers to 
strategic partners driving organizational success. The framework sets the foundation for a new era 
of PMO management, where value creation and customer satisfaction are at the forefront, making it 
indispensable knowledge for any PMO professional aiming to stay relevant and impactful in today’s 
dynamic business environment.
By mastering this framework, PMO professionals can elevate their role from project management 
enforcers to strategic value creators. The framework equips PMO professionals with the tools to 
design, implement, operate, and evolve PMOs that consistently deliver value and contribute directly 
to organizational success.
Introducing the New PMO Value Ring™ Framework
The PMO Value Ring™ framework represents a groundbreaking approach for PMO professionals, 
marking a significant paradigm shift in how PMOs function and deliver value within organizations. 
This innovative framework goes beyond traditional PMO models by emphasizing value creation 
and delivery, effectively transforming PMOs from being perceived as mere tactical and operational 
overseers into strategic partners that drive organizational success.
At the core of the PMO Value Ring™ framework lies the critical alignment between projects and 
strategic goals. This alignment ensures that every project, regardless of its size or scope, contributes 
meaningfully to the overarching objectives of the organization. By doing so, the framework elevates 
the role of the PMO, positioning it as an indispensable catalyst in achieving long-term organizational 
success. This strategic alignment is not just about mapping projects to goals; it is about creating a 
symbiotic relationship where project outcomes directly fuel strategic achievements.
The framework’s strength lies in its flexible, transparent, and customer-centric approach that 
maximizes value creation. It encourages PMOs to adopt a more dynamic and proactive role, moving 
away from the traditional, reactive stance often associated with project management offices. By 
focusing on delivering measurable benefits and aligning their efforts with customers’ needs and 
business priorities, PMOs can effectively demonstrate their value to their organizations.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
Moreover, the PMO Value Ring™ framework promotes a culture of continuous improvement and 
adaptability. In an era characterized by rapid technological advancements and shifting market 
dynamics, the ability to adapt quickly is a critical success factor. The framework encourages PMOs to 
regularly assess and refine their processes, methodologies, and performance metrics. This ongoing 
evaluation ensures that PMOs stay aligned with the evolving needs of the organization and its 
customers. By embedding adaptability into their DNA, PMOs can become more resilient and better 
equipped to navigate the complexities of modern business landscapes.
The customer-centric aspect of the PMO Value Ring™ framework is particularly noteworthy and 
deserves special attention. By placing the needs and expectations of PMO customers at the 
forefront of their operations, PMOs can deliver more relevant and impactful services. This customer-
first approach represents a significant departure from traditional PMO models that often prioritize 
processes over people.
By focusing on customer needs, PMOs can tailor their services to deliver maximum value, enhance 
customer satisfaction, and foster stronger relationships. This approach not only improves the 
perception of the PMO within the organization but also builds trust and credibility with PMO 
customers at all levels.
The PMO Value Ring™ framework represents a critical redefinition of the role of PMOs within 
organizations. Focusing on value creation, strategic alignment, and customer centricity enables 
PMOs to transition from being operational support units to becoming strategic enablers of 
organizational success. This transformation is not just beneficial; it is essential for PMOs to remain 
relevant and effective in an increasingly complex and competitive business landscape.
PMO professionals who master this framework elevate their role from mere enforcers of processes 
and tools to true creators of value. Equipped with the recommended practices outlined here, they 
gain the skills to design, implement, operate, and continuously improve PMOs that reliably deliver 
value and make a tangible impact on organizational success. By shifting their focus to strategic 
alignment and measurable outcomes, these professionals can build PMOs that not only support 
project execution but also drive business growth, enhance PMO customer satisfaction, and foster 
a culture of continuous improvement. In doing so, they position the PMO as a central player in 
achieving long-term organizational goals.
The primary goal for which the PMO Value Ring™ framework was designed is value generation. 
This goal goes beyond completing projects on time and within budget; it ensures that each 
PMO customer can achieve their project-related objectives, thus contributing directly to the 
organization’s strategic goals.
The framework emphasizes generating valuable outcomes through strong customer orientation, 
a trend witnessed in successful PMOs across the globe. The following five key elements were 
incorporated into the present framework to ensure consistent delivery of such value by PMOs 
(see Figure 9-1):
•	 PMO customer. At the center is the PMO customer, who serves as the primary reference point 
for PMO professionals as they continuously shape PMO strategies, define objectives, and manage 
operations. By becoming a true partner to its key customers, the PMO can effectively generate 
value for them and for the organization as a whole.

•	 Organizational baseline elements. These elements are foundational components in any 
application of the PMO Value Ring™ framework. The elements include organizational strategy, 
culture and maturity, structure, and industry-specific profile, forming the backdrop that 
enables customized approaches aligned with the unique needs of each scenario. Through this 
integration, PMOs become more deeply embedded within organizations, enhancing their ability 
to generate value.
•	 PMO structural components. These components form the pillars upon which successful PMOs 
are built. The pillars include the PMO mandate, PMO strategy, and PMO governance. These 
components define essential aspects of a PMO, establishing objectives, scope of operations, 
responsibilities, authority, and a clear vision for the PMO’s evolutionary journey within the 
organization.

•	 PMO customer experience cycle. This stage consists of exploration, design, deployment, 
enhancement, and realization—all aimed at delivering effective value through positive and 
ever-changing experiences with PMO customers. This stage is an iterative cycle that responds 
continuously to evolving customers’ needs, expectations, and feedback, hence playing the role 
of a binding agent between customers and PMOs, ensuring that the PMO becomes increasingly 
relevant and strategic within the organization.
•	 Value-generating PMO flywheel. At its core, the value-generating PMO flywheel breaks down 
the PMO customer experience cycle into actionable steps that highlight the continuous nature 
of value generation, with each successive cycle building momentum for future successes.
Moving Beyond One-Size-Fits-All PMO Models
A crucial aspect of the PMO Value Ring™ framework is that it sets itself apart from conventional 
approaches, which, while valuable sources of inspiration, do not adequately represent the diversity 
of PMOs in the real world. While many traditional models advocate for an “ideal PMO” as a universal 
benchmark, the PMO Value Ring™ framework takes a fundamentally different approach. This 
innovative framework recognizes that successful PMOs vary significantly across organizations 
and considers this variability a vital component of PMO success, rather than a deviation from a 
standardized model.
The PMO Value Ring™ framework emphasizes that each PMO should be uniquely tailored to meet 
the specific needs, goals, and cultural nuances of its organization. By focusing on a flexible and 
customer-centric approach, the framework empowers PMO leaders to adapt their strategies, 
prioritize relevant services, and align their efforts with the organization’s unique objectives. This 
adaptability not only enhances the PMO’s effectiveness but also strengthens its ability to deliver 
measurable value and support long-term business success, positioning the PMO as a dynamic 
contributor rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.
Experience shows that successful PMOs in diverse organizations worldwide exhibit unique 
characteristics, and this diversity is a critical success factor. Recognizing this, the PMO Value 
Ring™ framework does not impose a single, ideal model or PMO type as a universal standard for 
organizations to achieve. Instead, it acknowledges the value of the various perspectives offered in 
literature as sources of inspiration rather than ready-made solutions. These perspectives serve as 
adaptable ideas, providing PMO professionals with options to draw from while considering their 
organization’s specific needs, strategic goals, and unique environment.
The PMO Value Ring™ framework serves as a “bridge” that empowers PMO professionals to design 
their own customized solutions, recognizing that each organization has unique needs, challenges, 
and cultural contexts shaping its ideal PMO structure. Rather than aiming to replace existing 
models, the framework acknowledges their validity and usefulness as sources of inspiration. Instead 
of prescribing what a PMO should be, the focus is instead on guiding how the PMO should be 
created and bridging diverse perspectives. This approach enables professionals to refine and adapt 
these perspectives into unique solutions that meet the specific requirements of each organizational 
context.

Framework Overview  105
In practice, the application of the PMO Value Ring™ framework might result in vastly different PMO 
structures, even within the same industry. For instance, two technology companies might end 
up with distinctly different PMO models based on their specific growth stages, market positions, 
organizational cultures, and strategic priorities. This adaptability is particularly valuable in today’s 
fast-paced business environment, where organizations need to be agile and responsive to change.
A PMO designed and managed using the PMO Value Ring™ framework is inherently more flexible 
and better positioned to evolve alongside the organization it serves. This approach demonstrates 
that successful PMOs differ significantly from one organization to another and acknowledges this 
variability as a critical factor in PMO success, rather than viewing it as a deviation from a standard 
model.
The following sections delve into each aspect of the PMO Value Ring™ framework, allowing PMO 
professionals to thoroughly understand its components.
Looking Ahead to the Next Section
The PMO Value Ring™ framework is a comprehensive model that can help PMO professionals 
to build value-driven, customer-centric PMOs. However, to apply the framework effectively, it is 
essential to understand the key elements that shape the PMO’s design and management.
The following section explores the organizational baseline elements—factors like strategy, 
structure, culture, and industry profiles—that define the environment in which a PMO operates. By 
gaining a deeper understanding of these foundational elements, PMO professionals can better align 
their efforts with their organization’s unique context, ensuring that their PMOs meet organizational 
needs and constraints.

The Organizational Baseline 
Elements
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
Understanding the organizational baseline elements is crucial for PMO professionals, as they form 
the foundation of a successful PMO. This section explores four critical elements that are akin to an 
organization’s DNA, shaping the environment in which a PMO operates and influencing its design, 
operation, and ultimate impact.
Comprehending these baseline elements is essential for PMO professionals to create a PMO that 
aligns seamlessly with the organization’s goals and culture. This understanding enables PMO 
professionals to navigate complex organizational dynamics, adapt to changing environments, and 
position the PMO as an indispensable catalyst for organizational success.
This section provides PMO professionals with the knowledge and skills needed to analyze their 
organization’s unique context, tailor their approach accordingly, and create sustainable PMO 
success.
Decoding the Organizational Context
The first component of the PMO Value Ring™ framework is the organizational baseline elements, 
which form the foundation for a successful PMO. See Figure 10-1.
A PMO does not exist in isolation or operate in a vacuum. It is a part of its organization’s 
ecosystem. As the survival and prosperity of a living organism both depend on a proper fit with its 
surroundings, a successful PMO is contingent upon its capacity for aligning with and leveraging 
its foundation. Failure to consider these elements may lead to a PMO becoming alienated and a 
possible failure to demonstrate value and gain traction within the organization.
Four critical elements determine how a PMO should be designed and operated:
•	 Organizational strategy. Organizational strategy provides a clear direction and purpose for the 
PMO, acting as a guiding compass. Aligning closely with organizational strategy makes the PMO 
a powerful catalyst for strategic execution that translates top-level objectives into tangible PMO 
outcomes, thereby driving organizational success.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
•	 Organizational structure. PMOs operate within the organizational structure framework. 
The ability of any given PMO to perform well depends mainly on whether it can navigate around 
an organization’s preexisting structure to develop supportive processes and methods that 
will blend smoothly with already established hierarchies and communication channels. It is 
important to understand the “true structure,” as the real dependencies, power, and influence 
network often differ from what is shown on organizational charts.
•	 Organizational culture and maturity. Invisible forces such as organizational culture and 
maturity can propel some PMOs forward but hinder others’ progress. Successful PMOs should 
consider such features while incrementally raising the overall level of project management 
maturity when dealing with projects based on cultural norms.

•	 Industry-specific profile. The industry-specific profile provides the broader context against 
which a PMO operates. This element implies that each industry has certain particularities in 
terms of regulations, practices, or challenges that may force any given PMO toward adjusting its 
strategies, methodologies, and areas of focus correspondingly.
Taken together, these elements form an organization’s DNA—melding the environment within 
which a PMO functions while influencing its design, operation, and ultimate impact every step 
of the way. The concept of “organizational DNA” is more than just a metaphor; it represents every 
organization’s unique characteristics. For PMOs, understanding this DNA is the first step toward 
establishing a mutually beneficial relationship between the PMO and the wider organization.
These four organizational baseline elements create an individual stamp for each organization, which 
requires different tailored approaches for PMO implementation and management. Each aspect has 
significance in its own right; however, it is their connection that really gives meaning to the PMO 
as presented under an operational context. One misalignment can cause chain reactions that may 
influence how effective and valuable a PMO can be. Therefore, comprehending these interactions 
is crucial for any PMO executive who wants to create sustainable value while driving organizational 
transformation.
These elements are also not static. They can change with market shifts, business growth, or new 
strategic challenges. Successful PMO professionals should consistently adjust their strategies to 
position their PMOs as indispensable catalysts for organizational success.
These elements are explained in greater detail next, examining their finer aspects and how they 
impact the PMO. This broader perspective can grant PMO professionals significant knowledge and 
skills to help navigate complex issues related to organizations, thereby enhancing the sustainability 
of PMO success.
Organizational Strategy: The Backbone of PMO Success
Organizational strategy is the foundational compass for a PMO, providing critical direction and 
purpose. Just as a ship in rough waters relies on a map and compass to steer it where desired, 
organizational strategy acts as the compass that guides the way through the intricate maze of 
project management.
The organizational strategy is like an organization’s roadmap toward its vision. The strategy outlines 
where an organization wants to go and how it wants to get there, including setting goals, long-
term objectives, and practical steps for achievement. For PMO professionals, understanding this 
strategy well is not optional but, rather, a necessary trait. Inattentive movement or a lack of a clear 
understanding by a PMO team about organizational strategy can lead to purposeless activities with 
no meaningful impact.
A company’s strategic priorities and goals are stipulated in the organizational strategy. When 
there is a change in strategic priorities or goals, such as a shift in organizational strategy, the PMO 
should realign its focus accordingly. For example, if in the future an organization decides to pivot 
toward innovation, then it may have projects that foster innovation and could possibly develop

new methodologies supporting these types of projects within the PMO team. Such alignment helps 
ensure that all efforts delivered by the PMO are relevant, enhancing its value toward achieving 
overall strategic objectives.
The influence of organizational strategy on PMO operations is both profound and multifaceted as 
seen in these areas:
•	 Portfolio management. Organizational strategy provides a critical filter for project selection 
and prioritization. The PMO evaluates potential projects through this lens, ensuring resources are 
directed at initiatives that truly contribute to organizational goals.
•	 Methodology selection. Strategic considerations often come into play when deciding among 
adaptive, predictive, or hybrid approaches. For example, strategies focused on rapid innovation 
may lean more toward an agile approach, while those targeting predictability would tend more 
toward a traditional approach.
•	 Capability development. PMOs that understand the direction of the organization and are 
forward-looking can cultivate the right team skills and competencies to prepare for future needs 
rather than just meeting today’s demands.
•	 Technology adoption. Tools and technologies often accompany strategic priorities. For 
example, a strategy focused on data-driven decision-making may include investments in modern 
analytics platforms or the innovative potential of artificial intelligence.
•	 Governance structure. An organization’s approach to risk and innovation influences a PMO’s 
level of control and oversight. A more flexible governance structure may be required when rapid 
market expansion is emphasized.
Understanding the company’s objectives alone is insufficient for effective strategic alignment; 
action is needed beyond this point to integrate these goals proactively into all aspects of PMO 
operations. PMOs that successfully align themselves with their organization’s strategies frequently 
transform from simple project execution nodes to trusted strategic partners. These PMOs become 
instrumental in not only implementing strategy but also in informing and shaping it, providing 
valuable insights derived from their unique vantage point overseeing multiple projects and 
initiatives across the organization.
Aligning the PMO with organizational strategy should not be set up once; instead, it requires 
constant tuning over time, and an effective PMO should be able to adapt quickly when these 
changes occur. This dynamic alignment helps ensure that the PMO continues to deliver value and 
remains a critical driver of organizational success.
Organizational Culture and Maturity: The Invisible Forces Shaping 
the PMO
PMO success is significantly influenced by organizational culture and maturity, which are unseen 
forces. It is important for PMO professionals to comprehensively understand these inputs as they 
seek to establish a PMO that adds value and thrives within their organization’s unique nature.

The Organizational Baseline Elements  111
Organizational culture involves an organization’s overall values, belief systems, attitudes, and 
practices. Organizational culture may be seen in the underlying rules of operation, rewarded 
behaviors, and dominant mindsets. In this case, maturity refers to how advanced organizations are 
with project management techniques at the portfolio, program, and project levels. Hence, these 
dynamics either become launching pads or obstacles to PMO success.
The dynamic between an organization’s evolving culture and maturing project management 
practices has a significant impact on the PMO itself. For instance, a more mature organization may 
require more sophisticated project tracking and reporting mechanisms, which the PMO should 
implement. Similarly, a shift toward a more collaborative or innovative culture may necessitate 
changes in how the PMO fosters team dynamics and project execution.
Critical aspects of organizational culture and maturity that PMO professionals should consider include:
•	 Values and norms. Value and norms comprise the basic principles used when making choices 
within an organization.
•	 Communication patterns. These patterns influence how information flows through the 
organization, whether flat or hierarchical.
•	 Risk tolerance. Risk tolerance determines how well the organization handles uncertainty, 
including innovation.
•	 Decision-making processes. Decision-making processes help determine whether decisions are 
made by consensus or from the top down.
•	 Collaborative dynamics. The collaboration dynamics influence how different departments work 
together within the organization.
•	 Change readiness and adaptability. These factors influence the organization’s ability to accept 
and absorb new ideas.
•	 Organizational project management maturity. This level of maturity influences an 
organization’s level of knowledge, understanding, and application of portfolio, program, and 
project management practices.
•	 Hidden interests and informal authority. These factors include unofficial power structures, 
patterns, and interests that may influence decision-making and reporting within an organization.
The implementation and operation of a PMO are highly influenced by an organization’s 
environment. PMO professionals should consider the organization’s history with PMOs such as any 
past successes or failures.
The perceived value of the PMO and its ability to execute complex practices depend on 
organizational project management maturity and the acumen of PMO customers. In less mature 
environments, starting with simpler processes before introducing more advanced approaches is 
often necessary.
PMOs should not forget that organizational maturity and culture are dynamic; they change over 
time due to external pressures, transformational leadership, and strategic reorientation. Successful 
PMO professionals track such changes and adjust their approaches accordingly.

Organizational Structure: Integrating the PMO With the 
Organization
Organizational structure forms the foundational framework that shapes the effectiveness of a PMO. 
It serves as a blueprint, defining how various components of an organization interact and function 
together.
A deep understanding of the organizational structure is crucial for PMO professionals to create 
an influential and effective PMO that seamlessly integrates into the organizational fabric. The 
organizational structure encompasses several critical aspects that directly impact PMO design and 
operations, such as but not limited to:
•	 Hierarchy levels. The layers of management and reporting lines;
•	 Decision-making authority. The processes and locations of decision-making within the 
organization;
•	 Departmental boundaries. How responsibilities are divided across different units;
•	 Communication channels. Both formal and informal pathways for information flow;
•	 Resource allocation. The distribution of human and financial resources;
•	 Governance models. Frameworks for oversight and accountability; and
•	 Cultural dynamics. The interplay between structure and organizational culture.
It is crucial to recognize that organizational structures are not static; they evolve as organizations 
change and grow. PMOs should stay attuned to these structural shifts and be prepared to adapt 
accordingly.
Changes in the organizational structure can impact the PMO’s role and how it interacts with other 
departments. For instance, if the organization undergoes a restructuring that affects reporting lines 
or departmental boundaries, the PMO may need to clarify its new role and responsibilities. This 
clarification can ensure that the PMO operates smoothly within the new organizational framework 
and maintains its effectiveness.
By profoundly understanding and skillfully navigating this structural landscape, PMO professionals 
can create a PMO that fits seamlessly into the organizational structure and becomes a driving force 
for efficiency, collaboration, and strategic success. This adaptive approach ensures that the PMO 
remains relevant and valuable as the organization evolves, positioning it as an indispensable asset 
in achieving organizational objectives.
Industry-Specific Profile: Tailoring the PMO to Different Realities
An organization’s industry-specific profile can significantly shape the way its PMO operates. 
This profile encompasses the unique characteristics, challenges, and accepted practices of the 
organization’s industry or economic sector. For PMO professionals, recognizing and adapting to 
these nuances is crucial for driving real value and ensuring organizational success.

The Organizational Baseline Elements  113
Key factors that shape PMOs across different industries include:
•	 Regulatory environment. The regulatory environment varies across sectors and regions, 
influencing compliance requirements and operational frameworks.
•	 Project types. Project types can differ among industries, leading to methodology variations and 
unique management approaches.
•	 Technology landscape. Sectors and regions may differ in technological integration levels, 
affecting project execution and management.
•	 Market dynamics. Economic conditions, competition, and market trends may influence the 
priorities of projects’ timelines.
•	 Risk profile. Every industry has its own risks, which may necessitate the development of risk 
management strategies tailored to each sector.
•	 Stakeholder ecosystems. The diversity and expectations of PMO customers may differ from 
industry to industry, affecting PMO strategies.
•	 Industry standards and practices. Project management methodologies may be influenced by 
each sector’s applicable standards.
•	 Cultural and maturity factors. A PMO’s effectiveness may depend on the maturity level of 
project management practices in its respective industry as well as the sector’s cultural norms in a 
particular country.
To exemplify these differences, consider some industry examples showing how PMOs should align 
their approaches, methodologies, and focus areas with specific challenges, regulations, and good 
practices within sectors:
•	 Construction. This sector focuses on large-scale, long-term projects with a high emphasis on 
safety and environmental regulations and complex stakeholder engagement.
•	 Energy. The energy sector should consider regulatory compliance for its capital-intensive 
projects as well as rapid technology changes, particularly related to renewable energy.
•	 Financial services. The financial sector faces challenges with cybersecurity and regulatory 
compliance as well as the fast pace of technology adoption in the industry.
•	 Government. The government sector has unique considerations such as public accountability, 
complex stakeholder engagement, strict procurement laws, and long-term planning efforts.
•	 Healthcare. Healthcare organizations should consider patient safety, data privacy, regulatory 
compliance, and innovation that is balanced with efficiency.
•	 Information technology. The IT sector faces challenges with rapid project cycles, agile 
methodology considerations, innovation, continuous integration, and deployment practices.
To effectively meet these industry-specific requirements, PMO professionals should understand the 
importance of adjusting their approach to appropriately respond to their sector’s specific demands.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
This careful consideration of industry challenges has been demonstrated by successful PMOs, 
highlighting that flexibility is not just desirable but rather necessary for driving value in any project.
The fact that industry landscapes are dynamic is vital. PMO professionals should be ready to adjust 
strategies as sectors change, new regulations come into effect, and technology disrupts various 
industries.
An industry-specific profile is an essential determinant for all aspects of PMO operations. By 
blending project management principles and practices with sector-specific realities, PMO 
professionals can create customized approaches that help ensure their PMO’s relevance, 
effectiveness, and value within distinctive contexts.
Looking Ahead to the Next Section
The organizational baseline elements set the foundation for understanding the contextual factors 
that can influence a PMO’s operations. The upcoming section examines the PMO structural 
components—the PMO mandate, PMO strategy, and PMO governance. These components further 
build the foundation on which PMOs function, outlining their purpose, strategic direction, and 
operational framework. By mastering the development and implementation of these structural 
elements, PMO professionals can position their PMOs to deliver meaningful value within their 
specific organizational environments.

The PMO Structural 
Components
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
For PMO professionals, understanding the structural components of a PMO is crucial, as these 
elements provide the foundation for a successful and impactful PMO. This section highlights three 
core components—PMO mandate, PMO governance, and PMO strategy—that go beyond theory; 
they serve as practical, actionable pillars that bring the PMO to life.
By delving into these components, PMO professionals can establish a solid PMO structure and 
help ensure their PMO operates effectively, aligns with organizational goals, and delivers tangible 
value. This section equips PMO professionals with the knowledge to establish a solid PMO structure, 
fostering a strategic and value-driven approach in their organizations.
Building the PMO Foundations
At the heart of every high-performing PMO stands the PMO structural components, which provide 
the foundation for PMOs to excel. While the organizational baseline elements discussed in the 
previous section set the stage, providing the contextual backdrop against which a PMO operates, 
the PMO structural components bring the PMO to life, giving it form, direction, and purpose.
The complex relationships among the PMO structural components and the organizational baseline 
elements are of paramount importance. Each structural component is deeply influenced by—and 
should align seamlessly with—the organization’s strategy, structure, culture and maturity, and 
industry-specific profile. This symbiotic relationship can ensure that the PMO is not an isolated 
entity but an integral part of the organizational ecosystem, capable of effecting change and driving 
improvement from within the organization’s very fabric. The three PMO structural components 
earn the designation of ”structural” because they constitute the essential elements upon which the 
PMO is constructed. The components provide the necessary architecture for the PMO to operate 
effectively and efficiently.
A well-structured PMO is built on three fundamental pillars: mandate, strategy, and governance.

These elements work in concert to define the PMO’s purpose, approach, and operational 
framework:
•	 PMO mandate. This component defines the PMO’s “why,” articulating its purpose and 
justification within the organizational context. The mandate ensures that the PMO’s activities 
align with the organization’s strategic objectives, providing a clear rationale for its existence and 
operations.

The PMO Structural Components  117
•	 PMO governance. This component establishes the PMO’s “who” and “when,” setting forth the 
decision-making processes, roles, responsibilities, and accountability mechanisms. Governance 
guides PMO operations, maintaining consistency in its practices. PMO governance also defines 
the policies, procedures, and standards that govern the PMO’s day-to-day activities.
•	 PMO strategy. This component outlines the PMO’s “what” and “how,” establishing the long-
term plan that defines how the PMO will grow and evolve to continuously deliver value to the 
organization. PMO strategy focuses on the specific actions and improvements the PMO may 
undertake to enhance its impact over time.
These three components are far from theoretical ideas; they are practical, actionable elements 
that can bring a PMO to life, allowing it to navigate an organization’s complexities with clear 
direction and accuracy. The components serve as a critical bridge, translating broad organizational 
imperatives into a value-driven PMO that is ideally attuned to organizational needs.
In essence, the PMO mandate sets the foundation, PMO strategy charts the path for future 
development, and PMO governance enforces accountability and control. Together, they ensure that 
the PMO not only delivers value but also continuously adapts and aligns with the organization’s 
long-term vision and evolving maturity.
The interrelationships among the PMO mandate, PMO strategy, and PMO governance are crucial 
for ensuring the long-term coherence and effectiveness of the PMO. These three elements are 
mutually reinforcing: The mandate provides direction, strategy drives continuous improvement and 
adaptation, and governance ensures alignment and compliance. Together, they can ensure that the 
PMO is not only equipped to fulfill its current responsibilities but is also capable of evolving and 
improving over time.
In addition, understanding the intricate relationships among these organizational baseline 
elements and the PMO structural components (organizational strategy, organizational culture and 
maturity, organizational structure, and industry-specific profile) is crucial for PMO professionals. This 
understanding allows for proactive adjustments to the PMO structural components in response 
to organizational changes, ensuring that the PMO remains a relevant, effective, and value-driving 
entity within the organization. See Figure 11-2.
The three PMO structural components and their essential elements, implementation strategies, and 
good practices are presented in more granular detail in the next sections. Strategies to develop 
a clear and compelling PMO mandate, craft a PMO strategic plan that aligns seamlessly with 
organizational goals, and establish a PMO governance framework that ensures efficient, effective, 
and value-driven PMO operations are explained.
PMO Mandate: The Starting Point of a Successful PMO
The PMO mandate is the cornerstone of a successful PMO. It provides an all-encompassing 
declaration that defines the PMO’s purpose, coverage scope, and responsibilities in the 
organizational context. A well-articulated mandate serves as a guide to steer the PMO’s strategy and 
ensure it aligns with the organization’s overall goals.

The PMO Structural Components  119
The PMO mandate answers essential questions such as: Why does the PMO exist? What value is it 
expected to deliver? and Who are its primary customers? The closer the PMO mandate is linked to 
the organizational strategy, the more relevant and impactful its contributions can be.
The PMO mandate is involved in several crucial areas, including:
•	 Clarity of purpose. Clearly stated mandates are essential in minimizing confusion among 
stakeholders on who does what, leading to minimal conflicts.
•	 Responsibility definitions. To prevent underutilization or overreach, the PMO mandate 
determines limits on what the PMO can do.
•	 Stakeholder alignment. The PMO mandate can ensure that all stakeholders understand the 
PMO’s purpose and value proposition.
•	 Strategic alignment. The mandate helps “align” or synchronize the PMO’s activities with the 
organization’s strategic objectives.
•	 Performance benchmark. The PMO mandate provides baseline metrics against which the 
PMO’s performance can be measured and evaluated over time.
One significant factor defining the PMO mandate is the PMO coverage scope, which determines 
how far-reaching or influential a PMO can be. Typically, there are three levels as follows:
•	 Enterprise PMO. An enterprise PMO (EPMO) operates at the highest organizational level, 
aligning all portfolios and projects with strategic business objectives across the entire 
organization.
•	 Departmental/divisional PMO. The departmental or divisional PMO operates within a specific 
area, aligning projects within that area to the department or division goals. It has authority 
within the specified area.
•	 Program-/project-specific PMO. By definition, a temporary PMO operates in support of a 
specific program or large, complex project, aligning activities to the program or project and 
having authority over its scope.
The PMO mandate is greatly influenced by the coverage scope selection. The PMO coverage scope 
should be aligned with organizational needs and maturity levels.
The PMO charter formalizes the PMO mandate, clarifying in a preliminary perspective the PMO 
coverage scope, why it is needed, what it seeks to achieve, and where it fits within an organization’s 
structure. The charter establishes the initial pillars for PMO success, thus ensuring alignment, clarity, 
and organizational support.
The following items should be included in the PMO charter, which is developed from a high-
level perspective based on preliminary information collected. This information will be reviewed, 
validated, and detailed in the subsequent steps of this framework.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
•	 PMO purpose and mission. This information details why the PMO exists within the 
organization.
•	 PMO vision. The PMO vision explains what the PMO wants to be in the medium and long term.
•	 PMO coverage scope. The coverage scope can determine the level of influence that the PMO 
may have such as enterprise level, departmental or divisional level, or program-/project-specific 
level. However, hybrid structures, such as an EPMO combined with divisional PMOs within key 
business areas relevant to the organization, are also common.
•	 PMO objectives. The objectives represent the initially identified needs that led to the decision to 
establish a PMO.
•	 PMO stakeholders. This information includes a preliminary identification of the key PMO 
customers and an initial understanding of their needs.
•	 Basic resource needs. This information includes a preliminary evaluation of the resource needs 
required for the effective establishment of the PMO.
•	 Implementation roadmap. A preliminary roadmap should be included as a phased plan for 
establishing or evolving the PMO.
•	 PMO success criteria. The success criteria includes preliminary KPIs and metrics that will be used 
to measure PMO success.
•	 Review-and-update process. The review-and-update process provides a mechanism for 
periodically reviewing and updating the PMO mandate.
•	 PMO charter approval. The charter approval comprises any formal sign-offs or approvals from 
key stakeholders and executive sponsors that may be required.
These are foundational PMO aspects; they establish a PMO’s identity and purpose from a high-
level strategic and tactical perspective. However, it is essential to note that while the PMO charter 
provides an overview, it does not include all of the operational details about the PMO, which will be 
detailed in the next steps of this framework.
PMO Governance: The Backbone of PMO Operations
Effective PMO operations hinge on robust governance, which is crucial for ensuring that the PMO 
functions smoothly and adds significant value to the organization.
PMO governance encompasses decision-making processes, levels of autonomy, roles and 
responsibilities, accountability measures, and the overall governance framework within which 
the PMO works. Efficient governance helps ensure that a PMO is aligned with the organization’s 
objectives, operates transparently, and functions effectively.

The PMO Structural Components  121
It is important to note that PMO governance is different from portfolio, program, and project 
governance—all related concepts in project management. The key difference lies in their scope and 
focus as follows:
•	 PMO governance. PMO governance examines the policies, procedures, and standards that 
guide the operation/management of a PMO as an organizational entity. This governance 
includes a definition of reporting structures, decision-making authorities, accountability 
measures, and paths of escalation. The PMO governance framework also establishes roles and 
responsibilities within the PMO and delineates authority levels for different aspects of the PMO.
•	 Portfolio governance. Distinct from program and project management, portfolio governance 
oversees the entire portfolio life cycle to maintain strategic alignment. Portfolio governance 
focuses on the policies, procedures, and standards that govern the selection, prioritization, 
and management of an organization’s collection of programs and projects, ensuring optimal 
resource allocation and alignment with overall business strategy.
•	 Program governance. Program governance focuses on the policies, procedures, and standards 
that oversee the coordination and management of related projects, ensuring the realization 
of collective benefits and strategic objectives that exceed those achievable through individual 
project management.
•	 Project governance. Project governance refers to the framework of policies, processes, and 
decision-making structures that guide the planning, execution, and control of a single project. 
Project governance establishes clear roles, responsibilities, and accountability measures to 
ensure a project aligns with organizational objectives, meets stakeholder expectations, and 
delivers intended outcomes within the defined constraints of scope, time, cost, and quality.
While the PMO often plays a role in portfolio, program, and project governance, PMO governance is 
about how the PMO itself is structured and managed to support these other governance functions 
effectively. The PMO might develop and enforce governance standards for portfolios, programs, and 
projects, but PMO governance ensures the PMO has the proper structure and authority to perform 
these functions effectively.
A PMO governance structure should include:
•	 PMO roles and responsibilities. Who does what within the PMO, and how do they interact with 
the rest of the organization?
•	 PMO reporting lines. Who does the PMO report to within the organization? What are the 
established channels and processes for the PMO to report its activities, progress, and issues?

•	 PMO autonomy levels. What is the PMO’s level of autonomy and how are decisions made at 
various levels?
•	 PMO accountability. How are the PMO and its team members held accountable for their actions 
and decisions?
•	 PMO performance metrics. What are the KPIs established to measure the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the PMO?
•	 PMO compliance. How will the PMO’s adherence to organizational policies, industry standards, 
and ethical guidelines be ensured?
•	 Change management. How are changes to the way activities are conducted within the PMO 
proposed? How should approved organizational changes be launched smoothly and effectively 
communicated?
•	 Conflict resolution. How will disputes between PMO customers and other stakeholders be 
resolved? How can these grievances be forwarded to higher authorities? How should third

Effective PMO governance is essential for the success and sustainability of a PMO. The governance 
process provides the structure and guidelines necessary for the PMO to operate efficiently, make 
decisions effectively, and deliver value to the organization. By clearly defining roles, responsibilities, 
decision-making processes, and accountability measures, PMO governance can ensure that the PMO 
can navigate complex organizational landscapes while aligning with strategic objectives.
Implementing robust PMO governance is an ongoing process that requires careful planning, 
stakeholder engagement, and a willingness to adapt. As the PMO and organization evolve, so too 
must the PMO governance framework. Regular reviews and refinement of governance measures 
can help ensure that the PMO remains practical, relevant, and valuable to the organization and its 
customers.
The PMO governance framework develops alongside the organization’s journey through this 
framework. The governance framework begins as a simple proposal, built on the initial assumptions 
outlined in the PMO charter. At this early stage, the framework is deliberately kept straightforward, 
recognizing that much will be discovered and adjusted as the PMO grows and evolves.
As the PMO progresses, the framework naturally gains more clarity and detail. By engaging with 
customers and understanding their needs, the PMO refines its services and obtains more accurate 
information.
What starts as a basic outline gradually transforms into a comprehensive framework with clearly 
assigned roles, decision-making processes, and accountability structures. This gradual evolution 
ensures that the framework remains practical and aligned with the PMO’s ongoing development.

The PMO Structural Components  123
Taking this step-by-step approach allows the PMO governance framework to stay flexible 
and responsive to the organization’s changing needs. The PMO avoids the mistake of adding 
unnecessary complexity too soon and instead grows in a way that reflects its current state and its 
value contribution.
PMO Strategy: Charting the Course for Value Delivery
The PMO strategy is a comprehensive and dynamic plan that outlines how the PMO will deliver 
value to its stakeholders over the short, medium, and long term. This strategy is a crucial element 
that bridges the gap between the PMO mandate and its day-to-day operations, ensuring that the 
PMO remains aligned with organizational goals while consistently meeting the evolving needs of 
PMO customers.
Primarily, it is about creating a roadmap for value delivery. While this document provides 
information on “what” to do, it does not show “how” to do it. The following are some of the critical 
components of a typical PMO strategy:
•	 PMO vision and mission alignment. This alignment details how a broader, high-level vision 
and mission statement, as defined in the PMO charter, can be operationalized over different 
timeframes: short term, middle term, and long term. The vision and mission help PMO 
professionals understand their direction by transforming these aims into practical choices 
and measurable results. This effort links PMO performance objectives to the overall purpose, 
ensuring alignment in every aspect of PMO operations.
•	 PMO alignment with organizational objectives. The PMO strategy outlines how the PMO 
will continuously align its activities with broader organizational goals and strategies, ensuring 
that the PMO remains a valuable strategic asset in the organization. These activities include 
mechanisms for regularly reviewing and adjusting priorities based on shifting focus points 
within the organization or through showing a direct impact on primary business targets by 
projects through various means.

The PMO Structural Components  125
By addressing these components, the PMO strategy translates the high-level aspirations of 
the PMO charter into concrete, measurable action plans, helping the PMO to remain aligned 
with its core objectives while navigating the complexities and changes of the organizational 
environment.
The PMO strategy should not be considered static; it requires frequent reviews and updates to 
stay relevant amid organizational and environmental changes. Keeping the strategy dynamic is 
essential for ensuring it continues to add value by aligning with the organization’s evolving needs. 
These activities, usually conducted annually, allow proactive adjustments to be made, helping to 
ensure the PMO remains an important asset within the organization. Customer involvement should 
occur during these reviews, considering both internal and external factors affecting the PMO’s 
performance.
The PMO strategy begins as a high-level outline based on initial assumptions and goals. As the PMO 
engages with its customers, the strategy gains depth and specificity. This approach helps ensure 
that the PMO strategy remains aligned with organizational objectives, responsive to PMO customers’ 
needs, and focused on delivering increasing value over time.
Several critical situations warrant a thorough review and potential update of the PMO strategy:
•	 PMO establishment and evolution. This work is performed during the initial PMO setup, 
creating a foundational document. The document is then evolved upon reaching significant 
maturity milestones to reflect higher sophistication and set new goals.
•	 Organizational changes. This review is performed during major restructuring to align with 
new organizational designs. Reviews may also be performed when key customers change, 
particularly at the executive level, or following shifts in overall organizational strategy.
•	 Project portfolio dynamics. This review is performed after any significant adjustments to the 
project portfolio composition are made, as well as upon completion of any major programs or 
projects to incorporate lessons learned.
•	 External environment shifts. Reviews may occur in response to significant market changes, 
including industry trends and competitive pressures, and when facing new regulatory 
requirements or economic conditions.
•	 Technological advancements. These reviews may occur upon the adoption of new project 
management tools or methodologies or when implementing enterprise-wide systems or 
emerging technologies (e.g., AI, blockchain).
•	 Customer feedback and performance reviews. These reviews may be performed in response 
to substantial customer feedback about the PMO’s performance or value delivery. Reviews may 
also be done as part of the annual strategic PMO planning cycle to ensure ongoing relevance 
and effectiveness.
In essence, a well-crafted and regularly updated PMO strategy serves as a living roadmap, guiding 
the PMO’s evolution, aligning its activities with organizational objectives, and ensuring its continued 
relevance and value in the face of changing business landscapes and customer expectations.

Experience Cycle
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
Understanding the PMO customer experience cycle is crucial for PMO professionals as it represents a 
comprehensive approach to transforming the PMO into a strategic asset.
This section introduces a customer-centric framework that shifts the PMO’s focus from merely 
executing projects to delivering tangible value to customers and stakeholders. By adopting this 
cycle, PMO professionals can enhance their ability to meet evolving organizational needs, foster 
stronger stakeholder relationships, and drive continuous improvement.
This cycle provides practical insights into each stage of the customer experience cycle, highlighting 
how PMOs can adapt their services, measure success, and maintain strategic alignment. Embracing this 
approach allows PMO professionals to elevate their PMOs from tactical support roles to pivotal drivers of 
organizational success, ensuring they remain relevant, effective, and valued within their organizations.
From Concept to Value: The PMO Customer Experience Journey
The role of PMOs has transcended traditional boundaries, moving beyond mere oversight to 
become a strategic driver of organizational success. At the core of this transformation lies the 
PMO customer experience cycle, an approach that places the PMO’s customers at the center of its 
operations (see Figure 12-1).
The PMO customer experience cycle embodies a customer-centric philosophy and represents a 
paradigm shift in the PMO landscape. The cycle recognizes that the factual accuracy of a PMO’s 
success lies not just in the efficient execution of an organization’s projects but in the tangible value 
it delivers to its customers.
This cycle comprises five stages, and each one is carefully crafted to ensure that the PMO remains 
attuned to the evolving needs of its customers, continuously adapts its services, and demonstrates 
measurable impact and value.
•	 Exploration stage. This stage marks the beginning of the cycle, where the PMO engages 
in profound discovery to understand the current landscape, customer needs, and potential 
opportunities. The stage is characterized by educating customers about the PMO’s potential 
value and actively listening to their needs and expectations. This exploration sets the 
foundation for all subsequent stages by ensuring the PMO’s efforts are grounded in a thorough 
understanding of its customers’ realities.

operational complexities in this stage, integrating new services and processes effectively within 
the organization.
•	 Enhancement stage. This stage is about continuous improvement, driven by performance 
metrics, feedback loops, service maturity improvement, and agile adaptations. In this stage, the 
PMO works on increasing service maturity by consistently refining its offerings and learning from 
both successes and setbacks to enhance the value delivered.
•	 Realization stage. This stage focuses on measuring the outcomes of PMO services, 
demonstrating the PMO’s value, and ensuring PMO customer expectations are met. This stage 
emphasizes the recognition and appreciation of the value generated by the PMO, validating its 
contributions to the organization.
The Iterative Power of the Cycle
What makes the PMO customer experience cycle powerful is its iterative nature. It is not a linear 
process with a definitive end but a continuous loop of improvement and value creation. Each 
revolution of the cycle builds upon the learnings and achievements of the previous one, driving a 
spiral of increasing value and organizational impact.
The cycle is a dynamic and fluid process that operates as a continuous, interconnected system rather 
than a rigid, linear sequence. This concept is fundamental to understanding the PMO customer 
experience cycle’s effectiveness and its ability to drive ongoing value creation.
The PMO customer experience cycle is designed to be perpetually moving. While the stages—
exploration, design, deployment, enhancement, and realization—follow a logical sequence, they 
do not operate in isolation or come to a complete halt before the next stage begins. Instead, they 
overlap and intertwine, creating a seamless activity and value-generation flow.
In essence, the dynamic nature of the PMO customer experience cycle transforms the PMO 
from a reactive support function into a proactive value creator. The cycle enables the PMO to 
simultaneously manage current needs, anticipate future requirements, and continuously evolve its 
offerings to maximize the value it delivers to the organization.
Each stage of the PMO customer experience cycle is detailed in this section, showing how PMO 
professionals can leverage it to elevate their PMO’s strategic relevance, demonstrate tangible value, 
and become indispensable partners in driving organizational success.
The Exploration Stage: Laying the Foundation for Organization’s 
Evolution
The exploration stage is the crucial first step in the PMO customer experience cycle, setting the 
foundation for all subsequent stages. This stage is characterized by a dual focus: understanding the 
present and preparing for the future, which involves thorough discovery, active engagement, and 
strategic preparation.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
The exploration stage focuses on educating and nurturing PMO customers to recognize potential 
value that they may not yet be aware of due to varying levels of project management maturity. 
Exploration also involves identifying the current needs of PMO customers, setting the groundwork 
for developing a compelling value proposition for the PMO.
In this stage, the PMO takes on the roles of educator and investigator, fostering an environment 
where more advanced project management practices can be established while uncovering current 
customer needs. The objectives of the exploration stage include:
•	 Understanding the current landscape. Assess the organization’s project management 
environment by analyzing existing processes, tools, methodologies, and data on project success 
rates, challenges, and inefficiencies.
•	 Educating and nurturing customers. Elevate the organization’s project management literacy 
through workshops, seminars, and targeted communications, preparing customers to recognize 
and appreciate more sophisticated PMO offerings in the future.
•	 Identifying customer needs. Engage with PMO customers to understand their perspectives, 
challenges, and aspirations. Identify both explicit and implicit needs to inform future PMO 
offerings. Discover specific pain points and challenges that PMO customers face, providing a 
foundation for tailored solutions.
•	 Building relationships and trust. Establish strong relationships and build trust with PMO 
customers, from C-suite executives to project team members.
•	 Sowing the seeds of value proposition. Begin formulating the PMO’s value proposition by 
identifying how it will add tangible value to the organization, guiding the development of PMO 
services and solutions in subsequent stages.
At its core, the exploration stage is about discovery. PMO professionals engage with PMO 
customers—from C-suite executives to project team members—to build relationships, establish 
trust, and understand their perspectives, challenges, and aspirations. These interactions are not 
just about gathering information but about laying the groundwork for future collaborations and 
demonstrating the PMO’s commitment to adding value.
A unique and crucial aspect of the exploration stage is its educational component. Recognizing that 
the value of a PMO may not be immediately apparent to all customers, especially in organizations 
with lower project management maturity, this stage includes efforts to educate and nurture PMO 
customers. Through workshops, seminars, and targeted communications, the PMO begins to elevate 
the organization’s project management maturity, preparing current or potential customers to 
recognize and appreciate more sophisticated PMO offerings in the future.
The exploration stage is also where the seeds of the PMO’s value proposition are sown. By 
identifying pain points, understanding customer needs (both explicit and implicit), and aligning 
with organizational strategy, the PMO begins to formulate how it will add tangible value to the 
organization. This emerging value proposition will guide the development of PMO services and 
solutions in subsequent PMO customer experience cycle stages.

The PMO Customer Experience Cycle  131
Notably, the exploration stage is not a one-time event but the beginning of an ongoing process. 
While this stage marks the start of the PMO customer experience cycle, the spirit of exploration—
discovery and continuous learning—should persist throughout the cycle.
This stage is not just about gathering information; it is about building relationships, establishing 
credibility, and nurturing an environment where the PMO’s value can be fully recognized and 
appreciated. The insights and connections made during this stage will inform all subsequent cycle 
phases, ensuring that the PMO’s efforts are well aligned with organizational needs and poised to 
deliver maximum value.
The Design Stage: Crafting the PMO’s Value Blueprint
Following the exploration stage of the PMO customer experience cycle is the crucial design stage. 
This pivotal stage transforms insights and understanding gleaned from exploration into a strategic 
blueprint for action. The design stage is where the PMO’s potential value to the organization 
begins to take tangible form, setting the foundation for all subsequent implementation and 
operation stages.
The PMO’s vision focuses on the design stage, laying the groundwork for transformative change in 
the organization’s project management practices. Design is a stage of creativity, strategic thinking, 
and careful planning that will shape the PMO’s impact for years.
This stage is characterized by its emphasis on strategic alignment. The PMO should ensure 
that its proposed value and services are not just addressing immediate customers’ needs but 
are also closely aligned with the organization’s overarching goals and strategic direction. This 
alignment is crucial for gaining executive support and ensuring the PMO’s long-term relevance 
and success.
At its core, the design stage is about crafting a compelling value proposition, articulating how the 
PMO will drive meaningful change and deliver tangible benefits to its customers and the broader 
organization.
A key output of the design stage is the definition of the PMO’s portfolio of services. Selecting the 
right mix of services is critical, as it will shape the PMO’s ability to deliver on promises of outcomes 
and drive value generation for its customers.
The design stage also involves creating a roadmap for the implementation and evolution of the 
PMO. This roadmap provides a strategic view of how the PMO will roll out its services, build its 
capabilities, and gradually increase its impact on the organization over time. This stage considers 
the organization’s current project management maturity, resource constraints, and the need to 
demonstrate early wins while planning for long-term, sustainable improvements.
Throughout this stage, customer engagement remains crucial. The design process should involve 
key customers to ensure the proposed PMO strategy and services resonate with their needs and 
expectations. This collaborative approach leads to better design outcomes and helps build buy-in 
and support for the PMO’s future initiatives.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
It is important to note that the design stage is not about creating a rigid, unchangeable PMO value 
proposition and portfolio of services. Instead, this stage is about developing a flexible proposal 
that can adapt to changing organizational needs and customer expectations. The PMO value 
proposition and service portfolio outlined in this stage should be viewed as living elements, subject 
to refinement and adjustment as the PMO gains experience and the organization’s needs evolve.
The design stage incorporates several essential activities such as crafting a compelling PMO value 
proposition, developing a strategic service portfolio, and considering challenges the PMO may face 
during this crucial phase. The outcomes of this stage set the stage for successful implementation 
and value delivery in the subsequent stages of the PMO customer experience cycle. The design 
stage’s objectives include:
•	 Formulating the PMO value proposition. Develop a clear, compelling PMO value proposition 
that addresses the evolving needs and value perceptions of customers, delivering measurable 
benefits such as enhanced efficiency, project alignment, and improved resource utilization.
•	 Developing a portfolio of PMO services. Outline a portfolio of services based on the value 
proposition, identifying types that address needs and support the value proposition without 
defining details.
•	 Detailing PMO services. Define all necessary details for the implementation of each service, 
establishing processes, responsibilities, involved resources, performance indicators, agreed-upon 
service levels with customers, and established goals.
•	 Creating a high-level roadmap. Conclude with a roadmap for implementing the PMO and its 
services, balancing quick wins with long-term improvements in project management practices, 
while also considering customer needs, value delivery, and value perception.
As the PMO moves from design to the next stage, it carries a clear vision of how it will add value 
to the organization, a strategic outline of the services it will offer to deliver on this vision, and a 
roadmap for bringing this vision to life. These elements provide the foundation for the next stages 
in the PMO customer experience cycle, where the focus will shift to operations and performance 
measurement.
The Deployment Stage: Bringing the PMO Vision to Life
Following the design stage is the dynamic and transformative deployment stage of the PMO 
customer experience cycle. This critical phase is where carefully crafted plans and value propositions 
materialize into tangible actions and services. The deployment stage is where the tangible work 
begins—where the PMO’s potential value to the organization becomes a reality. This stage ensures 
that the PMO’s services are available and effectively integrated into the organization’s fabric, 
delivering tangible value from the outset.
In the deployment stage, the PMO’s impact begins to be felt across the organization. Deployment 
is a stage of action, learning, and transformation that sets the tone for the PMO’s long-term 
effectiveness and value delivery. Successfully navigating this stage is crucial for establishing

force that drives ongoing project management excellence and organizational success.
The Realization Stage: Solidifying PMO Value and Preparing for 
Future Growth
The realization stage of the PMO customer experience cycle is a critical phase that demonstrates 
the PMO’s current value and sets the stage for its future evolution. In this pivotal stage, the PMO’s 
impact on the organization comes into sharp focus, deepening relationships with its customers and 
preparing the groundwork for a new cycle of increased value delivery.
Realization is dedicated to quantifying and demonstrating the tangible benefits that the PMO has 
delivered to the organization, ensuring value recognition by the PMO customers. This effort involves 
measuring the actual outcomes of PMO services against the PMO customer needs and expectations 
established in earlier stages. Additionally, this stage focuses on understanding and assessing how 
PMO customers and stakeholders perceive the value provided by the PMO.
The power of the realization stage is its creation of a comprehensive picture of PMO value and 
impact that combines tangible outcome measurements with customer perceptions. This stage

is potent in deepening the PMO’s customer relationship. As tangible benefits are demonstrated 
and positive perceptions reinforced, the PMO strengthens its position as a trusted partner in 
organizational success.
Moreover, the realization stage is a culmination and a springboard for future growth. This 
stage marks the beginning of a new cycle in the PMO’s evolution, initiating an upward spiral of 
increasing value. The insights gained during this stage from measurable outcomes and customer 
feedback inform the PMO’s future strategies, allowing it to refine its services, target new areas for 
improvement, and align even more closely with evolving customer needs.
This cyclical nature of the realization stage helps ensure that the PMO remains dynamic and 
responsive. Each cycle builds upon the last, with the PMO continuously enhancing its capabilities, 
expanding its influence, and delivering enhanced value to the organization. It transforms the PMO 
from a static entity into a learning organization, constantly adapting and growing in response to 
successes and challenges.
The realization phase assists PMOs in strengthening their strategic position, securing resources for 
future initiatives, and setting the stage for an even more significant impact in subsequent cycle 
iterations. The realization stage’s objectives include:

Flywheel Overview  141
The intricacies of the value-generating PMO flywheel model can help transform PMOs from process-
oriented bureaucracies into agile, value-driven, customer-centric partners in organizational success.
The Value-Generating PMO Flywheel Dynamics
The term “flywheel” in this context is borrowed from Jim Collins’ business philosophy, as outlined 
in his book Good to Great. In mechanical terms, a flywheel is a heavy wheel that requires significant 
effort to start spinning but, once in motion, continues to rotate with its own momentum. In 
business, the flywheel effect refers to the idea that sustained, incremental efforts can create a self-
reinforcing loop of success.
Applied to PMOs, the flywheel concept suggests that as the PMO consistently delivers value 
and meets customer needs, it builds momentum. Each successful iteration of the PMO customer 
experience cycle makes the next one easier and more impactful, creating a virtuous circle of 
improvement and value generation.
The value-generating PMO flywheel is not a linear process but a dynamic, interconnected 
system of continuous improvement and value creation. Unlike traditional models that progress 
sequentially from one stage to the next, this cycle operates as a multifaceted, ever-moving 
mechanism. The flywheel is designed to keep the PMO in a constant state of adaptation, 
innovation, and value delivery, ensuring that it remains a relevant and indispensable asset to the 
organization.
This approach allows the PMO to simultaneously address various customer needs, develop 
tailored solutions, manage multiple services at different stages of maturity, measure its efficiency, 
continuously refine its offerings, and deliver and demonstrate effective value for its customers.
Imagine the cycle as a series of gears in constant motion. As one gear (step) turns, it engages 
the next while continuing its rotation. This means that the PMO is likely involved in activities 
across multiple cycle stages simultaneously at any given moment. For example, while the PMO 
is onboarding and delivering a new service (service onboard and service operation steps), it may 
already be gathering feedback and improving (service monitoring and service improvement steps) 
on other services previously implemented.
Simultaneously, the PMO can assess emerging needs (needs assessment step) in various 
organizational sectors while evaluating customers’ perceived value of specific services (value 
recognition step).
This multifaceted approach allows the PMO to be highly responsive and adaptable. The flywheel 
model can help address the needs of different customers at various stages of their journeys, manage 
multiple services at different maturity levels, and continuously measure and improve its offerings.
The cycle’s dynamic nature also means that learnings and insights from one step can immediately 
inform and influence activities in other steps. For instance, insights gathered during the value 
recognition step about customers’ perceived benefits can immediately inform the service 
development step, potentially triggering the redesign of an existing PMO service.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
Furthermore, this approach allows the PMO to maintain multiple touchpoints with its 
customers. It is not a matter of engaging with a customer once and then moving on; instead, it 
is about maintaining an ongoing dialogue, continually assessing needs, and refining the PMO 
value proposition. This continual activity across all stages can ensure that the PMO remains 
agile and responsive to changing organizational needs, preventing it from becoming static or 
outdated.
The 10 Steps of the Value-Generating PMO Flywheel
The value-generating PMO flywheel is intrinsically linked to the PMO customer experience cycle. 
While the cycle provides a high-level framework for customer-centric PMOs, the flywheel breaks this 
down into actionable steps.
The five stages of the PMO customer experience cycle—exploration, design, deployment, 
enhancement, and realization—each correspond to two steps in the flywheel, resulting in a 
10-step process. This breakdown not only makes the cycle more practical but also emphasizes the 
continuous nature of the process. As the PMO completes one full rotation of the flywheel, it does 
not stop but continues into the next cycle, building on previous successes and learnings.
Each step of the flywheel consists of the following:
Exploration Stage
•	 Step 1—Awareness building. This initial step involves making potential customers aware of the 
PMO’s existence and capabilities. This step is about creating visibility for the PMO and its value 
within the organization and educating potential and current customers about how the PMO can 
support their work and generate value.
•	 Step 2—Needs assessment. At this step, the PMO engages in deep discovery to understand 
the current landscape, customer needs, and potential opportunities. This effort involves active 
listening, data gathering, and insightful analysis.
Design Stage
•	 Step 3—Value proposition. Based on the insights gathered, the PMO crafts a clear value 
proposition for its services. This step involves articulating how the PMO will meet identified 
needs, deliver expected outcomes and benefits to its customers, and generate value for the 
organization.
•	 Step 4—Service development. This step involves creating, refining, or redesigning PMO 
services in comprehensive detail. It is a creative process that requires innovative thinking and 
collaborative problem-solving.

Flywheel Overview  143
Deployment Stage
•	 Step 5—Service onboarding. This step focuses on introducing new or improved services to 
PMO customers. The effort involves change management, training, and ensuring the smooth 
adoption of PMO offerings.
•	 Step 6—Service operation. At this step, the PMO delivers its services, managing day-to-day 
operations and ensuring consistent quality and efficiency in service delivery.
Enhancement Stage
•	 Step 7—Service monitoring. This step involves monitoring and measuring the performance of 
PMO services. The work involves collecting data and feedback to understand how well services 
are being delivered and whether agreed-upon efficiency goals are being met.
•	 Step 8—Service improvement. Based on a comprehensive PMO service maturity assessment, in 
this step the PMO identifies opportunities for improvement and enhances its services. This step is 
about continuous improvement, adaptation, and service maturity evolution.
Realization Stage
•	 Step 9—Value delivery. This step focuses on measuring the promised value to customers 
through the expected outcomes. This step ensures that PMO services are making a tangible, 
positive impact on PMO customers’ needs and organizational success. The step involves 
assessing, measuring, and communicating the value created by the PMO.
•	 Step 10—Value recognition. The final step is crucial for ensuring that PMO customers and the 
broader organization recognize and appreciate the PMO’s contributions. By continually assessing 
and measuring the customers’ perceptions of value, the PMO can demonstrate its ongoing 
relevance and impact, fostering stronger support and alignment with organizational goals and 
providing the momentum to initiate a new cycle in the PMO’s growth and evolution journey.
The Importance of the Value-Generating PMO Flywheel
The value-generating PMO flywheel is more than just a process model; it is a paradigm shift in how 
PMOs operate and demonstrate their worth. The main reasons for its importance include:
•	 Customer centricity. By focusing on customer needs and experiences, the flywheel helps ensure 
that the PMO remains relevant and valuable to its users.
•	 Value creation. The flywheel, with explicit steps for value delivery and recognition, helps PMOs 
move beyond process management to genuine value generation.

•	 Momentum building. As the flywheel gains speed, the PMO’s impact and efficiency increase, 
creating a self-reinforcing cycle of success.
•	 Adaptability. The model’s emphasis on continuous assessment and improvement allows PMOs 
to adapt quickly to changing organizational needs.
•	 Continuous improvement. The cyclical nature of the flywheel encourages ongoing refinement 
and adaptation of PMO services.
The value-generating PMO flywheel represents a significant evolution in PMO operations. By 
breaking down the PMO customer experience cycle into actionable steps and emphasizing 
continuous improvement and value creation, this model offers a path for PMOs to become true 
strategic partners in organizational success.
By embracing the value-generating PMO flywheel, PMOs can transform from cost centers into 
value drivers, from process enforcers into success enablers, and from administrative overhead 
into indispensable partners in organizational achievement. This model offers a roadmap for PMO 
evolution, ensuring that these crucial organizational entities remain relevant, impactful, and valued 
in an ever-changing business landscape.

Step 1: Awareness Building  147
Implementing the Awareness-Building Step
1.	 Identifying Potential PMO Customers
•	 Organizational structure mapping. Start by analyzing the organizational structure and 
identifying key departments, teams, and individuals involved in project-related activities. 
Consider various roles such as executives, project managers, team leads, and functional 
managers. Assess each potential customer’s current challenges, their level of influence on 
PMO adoption, and their potential impact on organizational project success.
•	 Strategic segmentation. Segment these potential customers based on multiple factors, 
such as their project management maturity, specific needs, pain points, and level of potential 
engagement with the PMO. This segmentation allows for more targeted and effective 
awareness-building efforts later on.
•	 Organizational power dynamics. Understanding the organization’s power dynamics and 
decision-making processes is crucial. Identify key influencers and decision-makers who can 
champion PMO initiatives. This knowledge helps in prioritizing outreach efforts and tailoring 
messages to resonate with different stakeholder groups.
•	 Developing customer personas. Create detailed, outcome-based customer personas 
for each major segment, outlining their characteristics, needs, preferences, and potential 
objections to the PMO. These personas can guide the development of targeted awareness 
strategies.
•	 Customer prioritization. Prioritize the identified PMO customer groups based on their 
potential impact on PMO success and the organization’s strategic goals. This prioritization 
helps focus initial awareness efforts where they can have the most significant impact.
2.	 Establishing Regular Touchpoints
•	 Audience tailoring. Map out customer groups’ preferred communication channels through 
surveys or interviews. Understand how they each like to receive information and their 
preferred frequency. Craft clear, concise messages that convey the PMO’s purpose, services, 
and value. Tailor these messages to different audience segments based on their needs, 
interests, and project management maturity.
•	 Communication channels. Choose communication channels based on the organization’s 
culture, customer group preferences, and the nature of the information. Develop a mix of 
methods, such as monthly email newsletters for updates, weekly intranet posts for tips and 
highlights, quarterly town hall meetings for discussions and feedback, and annual reports for 
comprehensive reviews of PMO impact.
•	 Content strategy. Develop a content strategy with a mix of informative and engaging content 
about PMO services. Include success stories, infographics, short videos, and regular updates on 
PMO achievements. Address the “What is in it for me?” question for each customer group.

148 
Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
•	 Content calendar. Create a content calendar detailing topics, frequency, and channels to 
ensure a balanced mix and avoid repetition. Establish a reliable cadence for each type of 
communication. Consistency is key, and customers should know when to expect different 
types of updates from the PMO.
•	 Interactive communication. Incorporate mechanisms for two-way communication in 
touchpoints. This communication could include Q&A sessions in town halls, feedback forms 
in newsletters, or regular “office hours” where customers can quickly visit to discuss PMO-
related matters.
•	 Flexible information. Consider creating tiered communication levels, allowing customers 
to opt in to different frequencies or depths of information based on their interests and 
needs. For instance, project managers might opt for more detailed, frequent updates, while 
executives might prefer higher-level quarterly summaries.
•	 Tech integration. Use technology to support your touchpoint strategy. This technology 
use might involve setting up automated email campaigns, leveraging collaboration 
platforms for real-time updates, or using project management software to share PMO 
dashboards.
•	 Track effectiveness. Regularly review the effectiveness of touchpoints by tracking metrics 
like email open rates, event attendance, and intranet post engagement. Use this data to 
refine the approach and be prepared to adjust the strategy based on organizational changes 
or feedback. Maintain consistency but remain flexible.
•	 Informal engagements. Do not underestimate the value of informal touchpoints. Encourage 
PMO team members to engage in casual conversations about PMO activities, attend cross-
departmental meetings, or participate in company social events to build relationships and 
maintain visibility beyond formal communications.
3.	 Educating Customers About PMO Value
•	 Educational library. Develop a library of educational materials tailored to different 
audience segments. This library might include executive summaries for senior leadership, 
detailed service catalogs for project managers, and quick-reference guides for team 
members. Ensure that all materials are written in clear, jargon-free language that resonates 
with each audience.
•	 Accessible training. Develop a series of sessions or workshops to provide an overview of the 
PMO’s purpose, explain key project management concepts, and demonstrate how the PMO 
can support different roles within the organization through its services. Offer these sessions 
regularly and make them easily accessible, perhaps through a mix of in-person and virtual 
formats.
•	 Success stories. Compile a collection of success stories and case studies that illustrate the 
PMO’s impact. These should be specific, data-driven, and relatable to the organization. 
Include a mix of quick wins and long-term successes to show both immediate and sustained 
value.

Step 1: Awareness Building  149
•	 Peer advocacy. Establish a “PMO ambassador” program, where satisfied customers from 
different parts of the organization can share their experiences and the benefits they have 
realized from working with the PMO. Peer advocacy can be a powerful tool for building 
credibility and trust.
•	 Benefit highlights. Develop a series of targeted “value campaigns” that focus on specific 
benefits or services. For example, consider running a campaign on how the PMO improves 
resource allocation, followed by one on risk management benefits. This strategy allows for 
in-depth exploration of different value areas over time.
•	 PMO portal. Set up a PMO portal or knowledge base where customers can access 
information about PMO services, accepted practices, templates, and tools. Ensure this 
resource is user friendly, regularly updated, and promoted across the organization.
4.	 Measuring Effectiveness
•	 Key performance metrics. Start by establishing a comprehensive set of metrics that cover 
various aspects of awareness effectiveness. Implement tools and systems to collect data for these 
metrics. A set of key quantitative and qualitative measures that might be considered include:
	
 Reach. Track the number of current or potential customers exposed to PMO 
communications through various channels.
	
 Engagement. Measure levels of interaction with PMO content such as email open rates, 
click-through rates, or attendance at PMO events.
	
 Awareness levels. Conduct regular surveys to gauge customers’ familiarity with PMO 
services and value proposition.
	
 Inquiries. Monitor the number and nature of requests for information about PMO services.
	
 Participation. Track attendance and engagement in PMO workshops, training sessions, or 
other events.
	
 Service uptake. Measure increases in utilization of PMO services following awareness 
campaigns.
	
 Feedback quality. Analyze the nature of customer comments and questions to assess 
their understanding and perception of PMO value.
5.	 Continuous Improvement of Awareness Efforts
•	 Awareness impact. Share the measurement results with key customers, including PMO 
team members and organizational leadership. Use these results to demonstrate the value of 
awareness efforts and to secure ongoing support for PMO initiatives.
•	 Continuous improvement. Review the results of the measurements regularly to identify 
areas for improvement. Look for trends, patterns, or anomalies that might suggest 
opportunities to enhance the awareness approach.
•	 Benchmarking. Regularly benchmark awareness activities against industry practices and 
other successful PMOs. This external perspective can provide valuable insights and ideas for 
keeping the awareness approach fresh and effective.

Step 2: Needs Assessment
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
Needs assessment is a critical step for PMO professionals as it lays the foundation for understanding 
the unique requirements and challenges of the organization and PMO customers.
This step enables PMO professionals to identify the needs and expectations of PMO customers and 
define the outcomes that should be delivered. This approach allows the PMO to tailor its services to 
address the most pressing needs. By conducting a thorough needs assessment, PMO professionals 
can ensure that their efforts align with actual customer needs and organizational goals, resulting in 
a more effective and impactful PMO.
Needs assessment provides PMO professionals with a data-driven foundation for decision-making, 
enabling them to make informed choices about where to focus their efforts and allocate resources 
most effectively to enhance the customer’s perception of the PMO’s value.
This step is crucial for demonstrating the PMO’s value to the organization, as it directly links PMO 
services to the specific needs of its customers. Ultimately, a well-executed needs assessment sets 
the stage for a successful PMO that generates tangible value and drives organizational success.
Needs Assessment Step at a Glance
Needs assessment is the second step in the value-generating PMO flywheel. As a pivotal step, it serves 
as a bridge between the initial awareness-building step and the subsequent value proposition step.
Its purpose is to thoroughly identify, understand, and document the explicit and implicit needs, 
challenges, and goals of PMO customers (see Figure 15-1). By conducting a comprehensive needs 
assessment, the PMO can pinpoint areas where it can add the most value, prioritize its activities, and 
develop targeted solutions that meet the unique requirements of the organization.
This process is crucial for maximizing the PMO’s potential impact and demonstrating tangible value 
to the organization. A comprehensive needs assessment helps PMO professionals to design a proper 
value proposal for the PMO, ensuring that the most critical priorities are addressed first.
Needs assessment also fosters a collaborative environment by actively engaging customers, 
building trust through active listening and responsiveness, and promoting buy-in from customers, 
which is essential for the successful implementation of PMO initiatives.

Implementing the Needs Assessment Step
1.	 Outcome-Based Needs Assessment
•	 Landscape mapping. Start by mapping the organization’s project landscape, identifying 
key customers at all levels who might be involved with or impacted by the PMO’s work. 
This analysis provides a baseline understanding of the organization’s project management 
maturity and identifies areas for potential improvement. Key aspects to consider in this 
analysis include:
	
 Existing methodologies and frameworks. Identify which approaches (e.g., predictive, 
adaptive, or hybrid) are currently in use and how effectively they are being applied.
	
 Tools and technologies. Evaluate the project management software, collaboration 
platforms, and other technologies being used to support delivery.

--- SOURCE: pmo_practiceguide_eng.pdf | PAGE 164 ---
Step 2: Needs Assessment  155
	
 Success rates. Analyze historical data on portfolio, program, and project outcomes.
	
 Resource allocation and utilization. Examine how human and financial resources are 
currently distributed across projects and assess the efficiency of this allocation.
	
 Decision-making processes. Understand how decisions are made regarding portfolio, 
program, and project management.
	
 Reporting and communication practices. Evaluate the effectiveness of current methods 
for sharing project status, risks, and issues.
	
 Stakeholder engagement and satisfaction levels. Assess how well different stakeholder 
groups are involved in—and satisfied with—portfolio, program, and project outcomes.
	
 Alignment with organizational strategy: Determine how well current portfolios, 
programs, and projects align with broader organizational goals.
•	 Customer matrix. Develop a comprehensive customer matrix, categorizing customers based 
on their role, influence, and potential impact on portfolio, program, or project outcomes. 
Employ empathy-mapping exercises to gain a deeper understanding of customers’ thoughts, 
feelings, and motivations related to the PMO. This mapping can reveal underlying needs and 
expectations that customers might not explicitly state.
•	 Engagement approach. Use outcome-oriented language in all interactions. Instead of 
asking about desired PMO functions, focus on the results customers want to achieve. For 
example, rather than asking if they need a risk management process, inquire about how they 
can feel more confident in making decisions related to portfolios, programs, or projects.
Note: To understand how to create a comprehensive assessment to identify the needs and 
expectations of PMO customers, read the section of this guide on PMO outcomes, where 
30 benefits are mapped from the experiences of PMOs in the global community.
2.	 Data Collection and Outcome Analysis
PMO professionals can gather insights into customer needs and expectations by implementing 
the following methods:
•	 Customer interviews. Conduct one-on-one interviews with key customers to gather insights 
into their specific needs, expectations, and concerns regarding the PMO. These interviews can 
uncover detailed information that might not surface in group settings.
•	 Surveys and questionnaires. Distribute detailed surveys and questionnaires to a broader 
customer audience within the organization. This information helps to establish quantitative 
data on customer satisfaction, needs, and areas for improvement.
•	 Focus groups. Organize focus groups with representatives from different customer segments 
to discuss their experiences and expectations with the PMO. This collaborative setting can 
provide diverse perspectives and foster open dialogue.
•	 Lessons learned reviews. Analyze project post-mortems or lessons learned documents 
through the lens of the identified pain points and desired outcomes. This process can provide 
rich, contextual data on recurring issues and successes.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
•	 Feedback loops. Establish regular feedback loops, such as periodic check-ins or 
feedback forms, to continuously gather and act on customer insights. This ongoing 
communication helps in adapting to changing needs and improving PMO services 
over time.
Note: Appendix X2 of this guide provides a valuable resource for PMO professionals: the 
PMO Customer Expectation Assessment. This tool is based on the 30 most common potential 
PMO outcomes discussed earlier and offers a structured approach to understanding and 
addressing PMO customer needs. The assessment enables PMOs to conduct thorough needs 
analyses; focus services on high-impact areas; and adopt a proactive, value-driven, customer-
centric strategy. The PMO Customer Expectation Assessment serves as both a diagnostic tool 
and a roadmap for generating value, guiding PMO professionals toward building a more 
responsive and impactful PMO.
3.	 Gap Analysis and Opportunity Identification
•	 Pain and gain mapping. Develop a “pain and gain” map for each customer group, clearly 
outlining their current challenges and desired positive outcomes. This map will serve as 
a foundation for designing the PMO value proposition and the services that will directly 
address customer needs.
•	 Customer journey mapping. Create customer journey maps to visualize the entire experience 
of different customer groups with the PMO. This process helps identify touchpoints, pain points, 
and opportunities to enhance the value the PMO provides to its customers.
•	 Value expectation matrix. Create a “value expectation matrix” that maps customer groups 
to their expected outcomes. This visual tool can help identify common themes across groups 
and areas where expectations might conflict.
•	 Future state visioning. Conduct “future state” visioning exercises, asking customers to 
describe their ideal project management environment. Focus on the outcomes they would 
like to realize in this ideal state, not on specific PMO services, functions, or processes.
•	 Validation. Validate the findings with PMO customers to ensure accuracy and alignment with 
their expectations and priorities.
4.	 Prioritizing and Addressing Identified Needs
•	 Structured prioritization process. Develop a systematic approach for identifying and 
prioritizing the most critical PMO customer needs. Evaluate the impact, urgency, and 
feasibility of addressing each need to focus on areas that will deliver the greatest value.
•	 Alignment with organizational goals. Ensure that prioritized needs align with the 
organization’s strategic objectives and goals. This alignment can help guarantee that PMO 
initiatives contribute directly to broader organizational success.

Step 2: Needs Assessment  157
•	 Communication of findings. Effectively communicate the results of the needs assessment 
to all relevant PMO customers. Transparency in sharing the findings builds trust and facilitates 
collaboration in addressing identified needs.
•	 Action planning. Develop clear action plans to address the top-priority PMO customer 
needs. Outline specific initiatives, responsible parties, timelines, and expected outcomes.
•	 Progress tracking and adjustment. Implement mechanisms to track progress in addressing 
identified needs. Regularly review and adjust PMO strategies as necessary to respond to 
changing circumstances or new insights.
5.	 Demonstrating the Value of Needs Assessment
•	 Link findings to outcomes. Clearly demonstrate how the needs-assessment findings 
contribute directly to organizational success. Connect PMO customer needs, PMO actions, 
and tangible results.
•	 Justify PMO resource allocation. Use data from the needs assessment to justify resource 
allocation and the prioritization of PMO activities. Evidence-based decision-making 
strengthens the case for necessary investments and support.
•	 Showcase tangible benefits. Highlight the tangible benefits and value delivered to PMO 
customers as a result of addressing their identified needs. Use success stories and metrics to 
illustrate the PMO’s impact.
•	 Involve PMO customers. Involve key decision-makers and PMO customers throughout the 
needs-assessment process. Their engagement ensures buy-in, support for PMO initiatives, 
and alignment with organizational priorities.
•	 Measure long-term impact. Measure the long-term impact of the needs assessment on 
PMO performance. Use these insights to adjust approaches and continuously improve the 
PMO’s effectiveness.

Step 3: Value Proposition
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
The value proposition step is crucial for PMO professionals as it serves as the cornerstone of their 
engagement strategy with PMO customers. A strong value proposition helps PMO professionals 
position the PMO as a strategic partner rather than just a support function. The value proposition 
demonstrates the tangible and intangible benefits of the PMO by aligning the specific needs of its 
customers with the outcomes set as its priority goals. By clearly communicating these benefits, the 
PMO can build credibility and trust with its customers, who are essential for driving engagement 
and collaboration.
In essence, the value proposition step is about translating the insights gained from the needs 
assessment into a compelling narrative that resonates with PMO customers. This step sets the stage 
for the successful implementation of PMO initiatives by ensuring that customers understand and 
appreciate the value the PMO can deliver.
Value Proposition Step at a Glance
The value proposition is the third critical step in the value-generating PMO flywheel. This step 
focuses on creating a clear and compelling narrative that outlines how the PMO will address the 
identified needs and pain points of its customers (see Figure 16-1).
The value proposition demonstrates how the PMO will deliver both tangible and intangible benefits, 
explains why customers within the organization should engage with the PMO’s services, and 
highlights the unique value the PMO brings. A well-crafted value proposition makes it easier to gain 
customer buy-in and support, especially with senior-level executives.
Implementing the Value Proposition Step
1.	 Synthesizing Needs Assessment Outcomes
•	 Comprehensive analysis. Review all outputs, including reports, survey results, interview 
transcripts, and any other relevant information.
•	 Needs categorization and prioritization. Identify recurring themes and patterns across 
different PMO customer groups. Create a master list of all identified needs, pains, and desired 
outcomes. Categorize these findings into broader areas to help identify potential services.

162 
Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
Prioritize the identified needs based on factors such as frequency of mention, perceived impact, 
and alignment with organizational strategy. Use techniques like weighted scoring or the 
MoSCoW (must have, should have, could have, won’t have) method to create a prioritized list.
•	 Pain point profiles. Develop detailed “pain point profiles” for each major identified 
need. These profiles should include a clear description of the pain point, its impact on 
customers and the organization, and any relevant quantitative data or evidence. Create a 
visual representation of the synthesized findings, such as a mind map or infographic, to 
communicate outcomes and guide the next steps.
2.	 Mapping Pains to Potential Solutions
•	 Collaborative creation. Conduct sessions with the PMO team to generate a wide range of 
potential solutions for each major pain point or need. Encourage out-of-the-box thinking 
without limiting ideas based on current capabilities or resources. Use the “how might we” 
method to frame each pain point as an opportunity.

Step 3: Value Proposition  163
•	 Solution design. Utilize proper techniques to map out customer duties, pains, and gains 
related to portfolio, program, or project management. This approach helps to clearly 
articulate how the PMO can alleviate pains and create gains.
•	 Feasibility analysis. Evaluate the feasibility of each potential solution by considering 
alignment with PMO capabilities, resource requirements, potential impacts, and ease of 
implementation. Use a scoring system to rate each solution on these factors. Identify patterns 
or commonalities among proposed solutions and group similar ideas together.
3.	 Defining the PMO Value Proposition
•	 Solution map. Create a visual “solution map” linking pain points to potential solutions. 
This mapping will help identify high-value services that can address multiple pain points.
•	 Articulating PMO benefits. For each high-priority solution, develop a service concept 
with a clear name, concise description, and the specific pain points or needs it addresses. 
Clearly articulate the value proposition for each proposed service using this format: “For 
[target customer], who [statement of need or opportunity], our [service name] provides 
[key problem-solving capability].” Identify quick wins to help build momentum and gain 
customer buy-in. To create an effective solution to PMO customer needs and expectations, 
refer to the section of this guide on PMO outcomes. This section provides invaluable insights 
into the most effective PMO services to generate PMO customers’ expected benefits. These 
recommendations are grounded in real-world experience drawn from the collective wisdom 
of PMO leaders in the global community. Remember, the goal is not to implement every 
possible service but to select and adapt those that will best deliver the outcomes PMO 
customers value most.
•	 Service outline. Develop high-level descriptions of how each service will be delivered, 
considering scalability, flexibility, and potential evolution as the organization’s project 
management maturity grows. Identify dependencies or synergies between services. To create 
an effective PMO service outline, refer to the section of this guide dedicated to PMO services. 
This comprehensive section presents a curated list of the 26 most common PMO services 
observed in the global community. Each service is carefully categorized and its applicable 
domains are specified, providing PMO professionals with a clear understanding of how these 
services can be most effectively deployed.
•	 Service blueprint. Create a visual, high-level representation of the core PMO services, 
showing how they relate to one another and to customer needs.
•	 Customer validation. Organize validation workshops or sessions with key customers to 
present service concepts and gather feedback.
•	 Customer value agreement. Create a “customer value agreement” for each major customer 
or customer group, outlining the outcomes the PMO commits to helping them achieve. 
Obtain formal approval to ensure alignment and buy-in.
•	 Evolution roadmap. Develop a “value proposition evolution roadmap” that outlines how the 
PMO’s offerings will evolve over time, using a rolling wave planning approach. This roadmap is

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
part of the PMO strategic plan and defines how the PMO’s value proposition will progressively 
evolve over time. It ensures that the PMO’s services, capabilities, and impact remain aligned 
with changing organizational needs, PMO customer expectations, and business objectives. 
By adopting this approach, the PMO can deliver incremental benefits and value while 
continuously reassessing the roadmap.
•	 Risk management strategy. Develop a PMO risk management plan to specifically address 
the risk of failing to deliver promised value. This plan should include a detailed process for 
identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks that could compromise the PMO’s commitments. 
By effectively managing this risk, the PMO can improve its reliability, strengthen customer 
relationships, and ensure the successful achievement of its strategic objectives.
4.	 Establishing and Evolving the Value Proposition
•	 Review schedule. Establish a regular cadence for reviewing the PMO’s value proposition 
such as quarterly for minor adjustments or annually for comprehensive reviews. Align these 
review cycles with key organizational planning periods, if possible.
•	 Review board. Establish a diverse “value proposition review board” with representatives from 
various customer groups to discuss the PMO’s performance and suggest refinements.
•	 Feedback management. Implement a systematic process for gathering and analyzing 
customer feedback through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews.
•	 Lessons learned. Document and share lessons learned from each review cycle within the 
PMO team to foster a culture of continuous improvement and build institutional knowledge

Step 4: Service Development
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
This section is pivotal for PMO professionals as it provides details on how to transform strategic 
insights and customer needs into actionable services that deliver tangible value.
The service development flywheel step takes the PMO value proposition and breaks it down 
into effective services that the PMO will provide, bridging the gap between understanding what 
customers need and effectively providing those solutions. In essence, the service development step 
is where the PMO’s value proposition becomes reality. This step involves a structured process for 
designing services that deliver the expected outcomes and benefits.
Service Development Step at a Glance
Service development in the PMO context refers to the systematic process of developing the services 
that the PMO will provide to its customers. This critical step in the value-generating PMO flywheel 
transforms the insights gained from the needs assessment and promises made in the PMO value 
proposition into tangible, deliverable services (see Figure 17-1).
Through well-crafted service development, PMOs can meet the expectations set forth in their 
value propositions, ensuring they remain relevant and impactful within their organizations. This 
iterative process can ensure that the PMO is able to respond dynamically to evolving challenges and 
opportunities.
Implementing the Service Development Step
1.	 PMO Service Delivery Approach Design
•	 Service delivery approach spectrum. Review each service concept and consider a 
spectrum of delivery approaches, ranging from full service (where the PMO takes complete 
responsibility) to purely self-service (where customers operate independently using PMO-
provided tools). For each service, carefully evaluate factors such as customer capability and 
maturity, the complexity of the service, resource availability within the PMO, and the overall 
organizational culture and preferences. This evaluation will help determine where on the

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
spectrum each service should fall. It is crucial to recognize that the appropriate delivery 
approach may vary, not just between services but also between different customers or 
projects for the same service.
•	 Service delivery matrix. Develop a comprehensive service delivery matrix that outlines the 
approach for each service. This matrix should include a detailed description of the service, the 
chosen delivery approach, clearly defined roles and responsibilities for both the PMO and its 
customers, and key touchpoints and interaction models. The matrix can serve as a guide for 
both the PMO team and customers, ensuring clarity in how each service will be delivered and 
accessed.
•	 Service delivery approach validation. Validate the proposed service delivery approaches 
with PMO customers. Seek feedback on whether the proposed approaches align with 
organizational needs and expectations. Be prepared to refine the approaches based on this 
feedback.

Step 4: Service Development  171
•	 Service delivery approach evolution. Consider how the service delivery approaches might 
evolve over time. As PMO customers become more mature in portfolio, program, and project 
management practices, or as the PMO’s capabilities expand, there may be opportunities to 
shift toward different types of approaches. Build this evolutionary thinking into the service 
delivery design, creating a roadmap for how service delivery might change over time.
2.	 Tailored PMO Service Process Design
•	 Service process mapping. Map out the end-to-end process for each service. This should 
include all steps, decision points, and handoffs. Use process-modeling techniques like 
flowcharts or swim lane diagrams to visualize these processes. Consider developing 
process variants for common scenarios to accommodate different project types, sizes, or 
complexity levels. For example, there may be a standard project initiation process but 
there may also be a need to develop variants for fast-tracked projects; complex, multiphase 
projects; or projects in specific domains. These variations can serve as starting points for 
further customization.
•	 PMO service risk management. Develop a comprehensive risk management plan for all 
PMO services. This plan should identify and assess potential risks to service delivery and 
quality, establish mitigation strategies, and create monitoring processes. The plan should 
integrate risk management into service operations, develop contingency plans for high-
impact risks, and ensure continuous improvement. This proactive approach enhances service 
reliability and customer trust.
•	 Process tailoring guide. Develop a tailoring guide for each process. This guide should 
outline which elements of the process can be customized and under what circumstances. 
Include criteria for when to use different process variants and guidelines for adapting the 
process to specific customer needs. The aim is to provide clear direction on how to modify 
the process without compromising its integrity or the quality of service delivery.
•	 Process documentation. Create comprehensive process documentation for each service. 
This documentation should include detailed process flow diagrams, step-by-step instructions 
for executing each part of the process, RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) 
matrices to clarify roles and responsibilities, and clear specifications for the inputs and outputs 
of each process step. This documentation will serve as a reference for both PMO team members 
and PMO customers, ensuring consistent understanding and execution of each service.
•	 Process change management. Establish a governance process for managing and updating 
the PMO service catalog. This process should include procedures for reviewing and approving 
changes to processes, version control mechanisms, and a schedule for regular reviews to 
ensure all processes remain current and relevant. Consider appointing process owners within 
the PMO who are responsible for maintaining and improving specific processes.
•	 Communication strategy. Define how processes will be communicated to PMO customers. 
Consider developing user-friendly versions of process documentation, perhaps in the form of 
interactive guides or video tutorials. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for customers to 
understand and engage with PMO services.

3.	 PMO Service Catalog Development
A well-structured service catalog is essential for communicating the PMO’s offerings clearly to 
PMO customers. Key elements in developing a service catalog include:
•	 Service name and description. The official name of the service and a brief overview of what 
the service entails.
•	 Value proposition. The unique value the service offers, the problems it solves, and the 
benefits customers can expect.
•	 Target audience. Specific customers, customer groups, or departments the service is 
intended to reach.
•	 Service owner. The person or team responsible for the service.
•	 Service delivery model. Details on how the service will be delivered.
•	 Service features. Specific features or components of the service.
•	 Technology integration. Appropriate technology is integrated into the service to enhance 
its efficiency and effectiveness.
•	 Service-level agreements (SLAs). Commitments on the level of service that customers can 
expect.
•	 Request and access procedures. How customers can request or access the service.
•	 Delivery timeframes. Expected timeframes for delivering the service.
•	 Resource requirements. Resources needed to deliver the service, including human 
resources, tools, and materials.
•	 Performance metrics. How the success of the service will be measured.
•	 Feedback mechanism. How customers can provide feedback on the service.
•	 Training and documentation. Available training materials and documentation to help 
customers use the service.
4.	 PMO-Service-Specific Performance Indicators and Goals
•	 Types of metrics. Define a set of metrics for each service. These metrics should include 
efficiency metrics (measuring how well the service is delivered), output metrics (quantifying 
the direct results of the service), and outcome metrics (assessing the impact of the service on 
customer and organizational goals).
•	 PMO service metrics definition. Create a detailed metrics definition for each indicator. 
This should include the metric name, a clear description of what it measures, the calculation 
method, data sources, measurement frequency, and who is responsible for data collection 
and reporting. Be sure to consider data availability and the effort required to collect and

Step 4: Service Development  173
analyze each metric. The goal is to create a robust set of indicators without creating an undue 
reporting burden.
•	 Collaborative design. Establish a process for setting customer-specific goals for each metric. 
This process should start with a baseline assessment of current performance. Next, conduct 
collaborative goal-setting sessions with each customer or customer group. These sessions 
should consider the customer’s specific needs, priorities, and constraints. Remember that 
different customers may have different goals for the same service based on their unique 
contexts.
•	 PMO performance dashboard. Develop a flexible performance dashboard template that can 
be customized for each customer. This dashboard should clearly display the customer’s specific 
metrics and goals, as well as actual performance over time. Consider using visual elements 
like charts or gauges to make the information easily understandable. The dashboard should 
differentiate between the metrics that will be used for internal service monitoring (measured 
in the service monitoring step) and those that measure service outcomes (assessed in the 
value delivery and value recognition steps). The measurement framework should capture both 
short-term service performance and long-term value creation.
•	 Review process. Implement a regular review process for these metrics and goals. This 
process might involve quarterly check-ins with customers to discuss performance, identify 
any issues, and adjust goals if necessary. Use these reviews as an opportunity to gather 
qualitative feedback as well, which can provide context to the quantitative metrics.
•	 Continuous improvement. Establish processes for analyzing trends, identifying areas for 
improvement, and implementing changes to enhance service delivery. This process might 
involve regular service review meetings within the PMO team, where performance data is 
discussed and improvement initiatives are planned, since the ultimate goal of these metrics is 
not just measurement but improvement.
5.	 PMO Resource Allocation and Competency Mapping
•	 Competencies analysis. Conduct a detailed analysis of each service, identifying the key 
competencies required for effective delivery. This analysis should go beyond just technical 
project management skills to include soft skills like communication and problem-solving. 
Create a comprehensive competency framework that outlines all of the skills needed across 
the PMO service portfolio.
•	 Current capabilities. Assess the PMO team’s current capabilities. This assessment might 
involve skills assessments, performance reviews, and discussions with team members about 
their strengths and areas for development. Create a skills matrix that maps each team 
member’s capabilities against the competency framework.
•	 Role descriptions. Develop detailed role descriptions for each service, outlining 
responsibilities, required skills, and performance expectations. These descriptions should 
be flexible enough to accommodate the fact that PMO team members may be involved in 
delivering multiple services.

174 
Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
•	 Resource needs. Based on the service designs and expected demand, determine the volume 
of resources needed for each service. Consider factors like service complexity, delivery 
approach, and anticipated customer demand. This assessment will help identify gaps 
between the current PMO team’s capabilities and the resource needs.
•	 Resource allocation. Create a resource allocation plan that assigns PMO team members 
to services based on their skills and the service needs. Consider implementing a matrix 
management approach where team members may have a primary service focus but can 
flexibly support other services as needed. This approach can help balance workloads and 
provide development opportunities for team members. Implement a capacity management 
process to ensure that resources are efficiently utilized across services. This process might 
involve using resource planning tools to track PMO team member allocations and availability. 
Regularly review and adjust allocations based on changing service demands and priorities.
•	 Managing competency gaps. Identify any skill gaps in the current PMO team and develop 
a plan to address them. This plan might involve training and development programs for 
existing team members or recruiting new team members with specific skills. Consider both 
immediate needs and future requirements based on the service-evolution roadmap. Develop 
a cross-training program to build redundancy in key skills. This planning can help ensure 
service continuity in case of absences or PMO team turnover and also provides professional 
development opportunities for team members.
6.	 Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) and PMO Customer Validation
•	 Creating SLAs. Draft initial SLAs for each PMO service. These SLAs should be based on the 
service designs, processes, and performance indicators developed in earlier activities. For 
each service, clearly articulate the scope of the service including what is and is not covered; 
expected response times and delivery timeframes; quality standards and acceptance criteria; 
roles and responsibilities of both the PMO and the customer; escalation procedures for issues 
or disputes; performance metrics; and reporting frequency.
•	 Service levels. Define service levels for each PMO service. This definition should include 
specific, measurable performance metrics and quality standards. Collaborate with customers 
to ensure these definitions align with organizational needs and expectations. Consider 
factors such as response times, delivery timeframes, accuracy rates, and customer satisfaction 
levels.
•	 Setting service goals. Set realistic and achievable goals for each SLA metric. These goals 
should balance customer expectations with the PMO’s capabilities and resources. Avoid the 
temptation to overpromise; it is better to set conservative targets that can be consistently 
met or exceeded than to set ambitious goals that lead to frequent shortfalls.
•	 Tailoring SLAs. When drafting these SLAs, consider different levels of service that might be 
appropriate for different customers or project types. For instance, there may be a standard 
SLA for most projects but an option of enhanced SLAs for high-priority or complex 
initiatives.

--- SOURCE: pmo_practiceguide_eng.pdf | PAGE 184 ---
Step 4: Service Development  175
•	 Validating SLAs. Schedule validation sessions with PMO customers or customer groups. 
In these sessions, present the draft SLAs and walk through each aspect in detail. Encourage 
open discussion and be prepared to negotiate on specific points. The goal is to reach an 
agreement that is both achievable for the PMO and satisfactory for the PMO customers.
•	 Building trust. During these validation sessions, pay particular attention to the performance 
goals included in the SLAs. These goals should align with the service-specific metrics 
developed earlier, but the goals may need to be adjusted based on PMO customer 
expectations and priorities. Remember that different customers may have different priorities 
and, therefore, different performance goals for the same service. The SLAs are not just 
about setting goals and measuring performance. They are a tool for building trust and 
fostering a partnership between the PMO and its customers. Use the SLA development and 
validation process as an opportunity to strengthen relationships and demonstrate the PMO’s 
commitment to delivering value.
•	 Monitoring and reporting SLAs. Consider how the SLAs will be monitored and reported. 
Develop templates for regular SLA performance reports and establish a process for reviewing 
these reports with customers. This process might involve monthly or quarterly review 
meetings where service performance is discussed and any issues are addressed.
•	 Communicating SLAs. Develop a communications management plan to ensure that all PMO 
customers are aware of the SLAs and understand their implications. This plan might involve 
creating summary documents or presentations highlighting key SLA points, conducting 
briefing sessions for project teams, or incorporating SLA information into the PMO 
onboarding processes.
7.	 PMO Service Implementation Planning
•	 Implementation roadmap. Create a comprehensive implementation roadmap for each 
service or group of related services. This roadmap should outline key milestones and activities 
from development through onboarding and into full operation. Consider dependencies 
among services and their impacts on the implementation sequence.
•	 Implementation plan. For each service, develop a detailed implementation plan including 
a timeline with specific dates for key activities and milestones, resource assignments for 
implementation and onboarding tasks, budget requirements for implementation and 
onboarding activities, risk assessments and mitigation strategies, and success criteria for 
implementation and onboarding.
•	 Service onboarding transition plan. Develop a transition plan from service onboarding to 
service operation, ensuring seamless handover and operational readiness. This plan should 
outline criteria for determining when a service moves from onboarding to full operation, 
handover procedures from the implementation team to the operations team, establishment 
of regular service review processes, and mechanisms for ongoing support and continuous 
improvement.

Step 5: Service Onboarding
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
Mastering service onboarding is essential for PMO professionals for several reasons. Firstly, it ensures 
a smooth adoption of new services. Effective onboarding helps users understand the benefits and 
functionalities of the new services, reducing resistance and increasing acceptance. This process 
maximizes the value and impact of PMO services, ensuring that they are utilized effectively and 
efficiently within the organization.
Secondly, service onboarding plays a crucial role in building credibility and trust in the PMO. 
By providing comprehensive training, clear communication, and robust support during the 
onboarding process, the PMO can demonstrate its commitment to helping stakeholders succeed. 
This commitment helps foster positive relationships and enhances the PMO’s reputation as a reliable 
and valuable partner within the organization.
A well-executed onboarding process sets the stage for long-term service success. By addressing potential 
issues early, gathering feedback, and making necessary adjustments, the PMO can ensure that services 
continue to meet user needs and deliver expected outcomes. This proactive approach minimizes 
disruptions and ensures that the new services integrate smoothly into existing workflows and processes.
Service Onboarding Step at a Glance
Service onboarding in the PMO context is a structured process that introduces newly developed or 
improved PMO services to their intended users within the organization. This critical phase bridges 
the gap between service development and full-scale implementation, ensuring PMO customers are 
prepared, educated, and supported in adopting new PMO services (see Figure 18-1).
Effective service onboarding is vital for ensuring the smooth adoption of new services, maximizing 
the value and impact of PMO services, building credibility and trust in the PMO, minimizing 
resistance to change, and setting the stage for long-term service success.
A well-executed onboarding process significantly influences the perception and utilization of PMO 
services, directly impacting their effectiveness and the PMO’s overall value to the organization. 
By carefully guiding its customers through the initial stages of service engagement, the PMO can 
foster a positive user experience, encourage consistent usage, and ultimately drive the realization of 
intended benefits from its services.

Figure 18-1.  Service Onboarding Step in the PMO Flywheel
Implementing the Service Onboarding Step
1.	 PMO Customer Preparation and Engagement
•	 Engagement strategy. Identify all relevant customers who will be impacted by—or involved 
in—the new services. Develop a comprehensive customer map that outlines each group’s 
current level of awareness, potential concerns, and expected benefits from the new services. 
Create a tailored engagement strategy for each customer group. This strategy should outline 
how the PMO will communicate with customers, what key messages need to be conveyed, 
and the plans to address specific needs and concerns.
•	 Building awareness. Develop a series of awareness-building activities to generate interest 
and excitement about the new services. These activities might include teaser campaigns, 
showcases of service benefits, or early adopter testimonials. The goal is to create a positive 
buzz around the services before they are fully launched. Organize kickoff events or town hall 
meetings to formally introduce the new services. These events should provide an overview

Step 5: Service Onboarding  183
of the services, explain how they align with organizational goals, and outline the onboarding 
process. Use these events as an opportunity to address any initial questions or concerns from 
customers.
•	 Customer feedback. Establish feedback mechanisms to capture customer input throughout 
the onboarding process. This effort could include surveys, feedback sessions, or a dedicated 
email address for questions and comments. Regularly review and act on this feedback to 
refine the onboarding approach and address emerging concerns.
•	 Identify champions. Identify and engage “service champions” within different PMO 
customer groups. These individuals can help promote the new services, provide peer support 
during the onboarding process, and serve as a bridge between the PMO and its respective 
teams or departments.
2.	 PMO Service Training Program Development
•	 Needs analysis. Start by conducting a training-needs analysis for each customer group. This 
analysis should consider their current knowledge levels, the specific skills required to use the 
new services, and any gaps that need to be addressed.
•	 Training curriculum. Develop a multitiered training curriculum that caters to different 
user roles and proficiency levels. This curriculum might include basic orientation sessions 
for all customers, in-depth technical training for power customers, and specialized modules 
for managers or executives who need to understand the strategic implications of the 
services.
•	 Training materials. Create a variety of training materials to support different learning styles 
and preferences. The materials could include user manuals, quick reference guides, video 
tutorials, interactive eLearning modules, and hands-on workshops. Ensure that all materials 
are clear, concise, and focused on the practical application of the services.
•	 Learning approach. Design a blended learning approach that combines self-paced 
learning with instructor-led sessions. This approach allows for flexibility while also providing 
opportunities for direct interaction and Q&A. Consider incorporating real-world scenarios and 
case studies into the training to make it more relevant and engaging.
•	 Recognize competencies. Develop a certification or competency assessment process to 
ensure that customers have acquired the necessary skills. This assessment might involve 
practical tests, quizzes, or a demonstration of service use in real project scenarios. Certificates 
or badges can be used to recognize and motivate user proficiency.
•	 Train the trainers. Establish a train-the-trainer program to build internal capacity for ongoing 
training and support. Identify potential trainers within different departments or teams and 
provide them with additional training and resources to coach their colleagues effectively.
•	 Ongoing education. Create a plan for ongoing education and skill development. This plan 
should include refresher courses, advanced training modules, and regular updates on new 
features or industry practices. By fostering a culture of continuous learning, customers can 
continue to maximize the value of the PMO services over time.

3.	 Pilot Implementation and Feedback Loops
•	 Pilot groups. Identify suitable pilot groups or projects that represent a cross-section 
of the PMO’s target customers. These groups should be diverse enough to provide 
comprehensive feedback but manageable enough to allow for close monitoring and 
support.
•	 Pilot implementation plan. Develop a detailed pilot implementation plan that outlines 
the scope, duration, and objectives of the pilot. This plan should include specific metrics 
for measuring the success of the pilot, such as user adoption rates, service performance 
indicators, and customer satisfaction scores. Ensure that mechanisms are in place to collect 
both quantitative data and qualitative feedback throughout the pilot period.
•	 Pilot support. Provide enhanced support for the pilot participants. This support might 
include dedicated help desk resources, regular check-in meetings, and on-site support during 
critical service-usage phases. The goal is to closely monitor the user experience and quickly 
address any issues or challenges that arise.
•	 Pilot feedback loop. Establish a structured feedback loop to capture insights from the pilot 
implementation. This effort should include regular surveys, focus group sessions, and one-on-
one interviews with customers. Encourage customers to provide honest, detailed feedback 
on all aspects of the service, from usability to perceived value.
•	 Pilot feedback analysis. Analyze the feedback and data collected during the pilot to identify 
areas for improvement or refinement. Look for patterns in customer behavior, common pain 
points, or unexpected ways that customers are leveraging the services. Use these insights to 
make necessary adjustments to the services, training materials, or support processes before 
full-scale implementation.
•	 Pilot feedback review. Conduct a comprehensive review at the end of the pilot period. This 
review should involve all key customers, including pilot participants, PMO team members, 
and relevant decision-makers. Present the findings from the pilot, discuss lessons learned, 
and collaboratively decide on any final adjustments needed before proceeding with full 
implementation.
•	 Leverage success. Leverage the experiences and successes from the pilot to build 
momentum for the wider rollout. Encourage pilot participants to become advocates for 
the new services, sharing their experiences and good practices with their colleagues. This 
peer-to-peer promotion can be a powerful tool in driving adoption and enthusiasm for the 
services across the organization.
4.	 Service Support Infrastructure Establishment
•	 Support levels. Define the different levels of support that will be required, from basic 
customer assistance to more complex problem-solving and service optimization. Develop 
a clear support model that outlines how users can access help, how issues will be escalated, 
and what response times they can expect.

--- SOURCE: pmo_practiceguide_eng.pdf | PAGE 194 ---
Step 5: Service Onboarding  185
•	 Knowledge base. Create a comprehensive knowledge base that includes FAQs, 
troubleshooting guides, good practices, and detailed documentation for each service. 
This resource should be easily accessible to all customers and regularly updated based 
on common issues and user feedback. Consider implementing a search function to help 
customers quickly find the information they need.
•	 Help desk. Establish a help desk or support team for the new services. This team should be 
well trained in both the technical aspects of the services and customer service skills. Develop 
clear processes for logging, tracking, and resolving support requests. Consider implementing 
a ticketing system to manage and prioritize support cases effectively.
•	 Support channels. Set up multiple channels for customers to access support, such as email, 
phone, online chat, and self-service portals. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots can also be 
implemented for this purpose. Different customers may prefer different methods of seeking 
help, so offering a variety of options can improve the overall support experience. Ensure that 
these channels are well integrated to provide a consistent support experience regardless of 
how users reach out.
•	 Customer communities. Consider establishing a user community or forum where service 
customers can share experiences, tips, and solutions. This peer-to-peer support can be a 
valuable complement to formal support channels and can help foster a sense of community 
around the PMO services.
5.	 Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Framework
•	 Success criteria review. Revisit the KPIs and success criteria defined during the service 
development phase. Refine these metrics to ensure they accurately reflect the onboarding 
process’s goals and align with organizational objectives.
•	 Performance dashboard. Develop a comprehensive performance dashboard that provides real-
time visibility into service adoption, usage patterns, and impact. This dashboard should include 
metrics such as user-engagement rates, service-utilization levels, time savings, error reduction, 
and customer satisfaction scores. Ensure that the dashboard is accessible to customers and 
provides both high-level overviews and the ability to drill down into specific details.
•	 Data collection and analysis. Implement tools and processes for data collection and 
analysis. This data collection and analysis might involve integrating analytics capabilities 
into the services themselves, setting up user surveys, or implementing usage-tracking 
systems. Ensure that data-collection methods are compliant with privacy regulations and 
organizational policies.
•	 Performance reviews. Establish regular performance review meetings with customers. These 
meetings should focus on analyzing the performance data, identifying trends, and making 
data-driven decisions about necessary adjustments to the onboarding process or the services 
themselves. Develop a standard agenda and reporting format for these meetings to ensure 
consistency and efficiency.

6.	 Transitioning to Full-Service Operation
•	 Successful onboarding criteria. Define what constitutes a successful transition. These 
criteria might include achieving certain adoption rates, reaching specific performance 
benchmarks, or completing a set of critical milestones.
•	 Transition plan. Develop a detailed transition plan that outlines the steps required to move 
from onboarding to full operation. This plan should include timelines, resource allocation, 
risk mitigation strategies, and a clear delineation of responsibilities between the onboarding 
team and the ongoing operations team. Consider a phased transition approach, gradually 
shifting responsibilities and focus areas.
•	 Handover strategy. Create a comprehensive handover document that captures all key 
information about the services, including design specifications, user feedback, known 
issues, and lessons learned during the onboarding process. This document will be crucial for 
ensuring continuity as the services move into regular operation.
•	 Knowledge transfer. Organize knowledge-transfer sessions between the onboarding team 
and the operations team. These sessions should cover not just the technical aspects of the 
services but also insights into user behavior, common challenges, and effective support 
strategies. Consider implementing a shadowing period where operations team members 
work alongside the onboarding team before taking full responsibility.
•	 Continuous monitoring and support. Establish ongoing monitoring and support processes 
that will continue beyond the onboarding phase. This process includes defining long-term 
performance metrics, setting up regular service reviews, and creating mechanisms for 
continuous improvement and user feedback.
•	 Communication strategy. Develop a communications management plan to inform all 
customers about the transition to full-service operation. This plan should include what 
customers can expect in terms of support, any changes to service access or processes, and 
how they can provide ongoing feedback or request enhancements.
•	 Onboarding success celebration. Plan a formal launch or celebration to mark the successful 
completion of the onboarding phase and the transition to full operation. This event can 
serve to recognize the efforts of all involved, reinforce the value of the services, and generate 
enthusiasm for their continued use and evolution within the organization.

Step 6: Service Operation
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
Mastering service operation is critical for PMO professionals because it is where the PMO’s promises 
and value propositions are realized. The ability to consistently deliver high-quality services is 
essential for establishing and maintaining trustworthiness within the organization. Effectively 
managing service operations allows the PMO to demonstrate its value and become an integral part 
of the business strategy, directly impacting project success and organizational performance.
PMO professionals can significantly enhance project management capabilities across the 
organization by ensuring that PMO services are available, reliable, and meet quality standards. 
Consistent service delivery fosters customer satisfaction and confidence in the PMO’s ability to

The service operation step in the PMO context represents the culmination of strategy formulation, service 
design, and implementation efforts. This step involves the day-to-day execution and management of 
PMO services, delivering tangible value to the organization and its customers (see Figure 19-1).
This critical step marks the point where the PMO transitions from preparation to action, putting 
its carefully crafted services into practice. It is in this step that the PMO builds its reputation, 
demonstrating its worth through consistent, reliable, and high-quality service delivery. By 
successfully managing service operations, the PMO can ensure that its offerings are readily 
available, dependable, and aligned with quality standards that directly impact project success and 
organizational performance.
Service operation serves as a real-world testing ground for PMO services. Through direct interaction 
with customers, the PMO gains invaluable insights that drive continuous improvement. As the PMO 
consistently delivers value through its services, it cements its position as an integral part of the 
organization’s strategic framework.

•	 PMO service daily management. Start each day by reviewing the service schedule and 
prioritizing tasks. Daily service-delivery management requires a proactive approach but is 
crucial to maintain a balance between scheduled services and ad hoc requests that may arise 
throughout the day.
•	 Communication channels. Establish clear channels for service requests and maintain open 
lines of communication with all customers. This communication might involve managing 
a service desk, responding to email inquiries, or conducting regular check-ins with key 
customers.
•	 Delivery monitoring. Actively monitor service delivery, identifying any issues or bottlenecks 
that may impact quality or timeliness. Quick problem-solving and decision-making skills are 
essential. When issues arise, address them promptly and transparently, keeping customers 
informed of any potential impacts on service delivery.

Step 6: Service Operation  193
•	 Delivery performance review. Review service-delivery performance, update service logs, 
prepare daily reports, or brief team members on completed tasks and upcoming priorities. 
Reflect on any lessons learned or potential improvements that could enhance service delivery 
in the future.
2.	 Executing PMO Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)
•	 SLA regular reviews. Review the active SLAs and their associated performance targets. 
A regular check helps to prioritize tasks and allocate resources effectively to meet SLA 
commitments. Use a dashboard or report that provides an at-a-glance view of current SLA 
performance across all services.
•	 Service request prioritization. Develop and maintain a system for prioritizing service 
requests based on SLA commitments. This system can ensure that services with more 
stringent SLA requirements, or those approaching breach thresholds, receive appropriate 
attention. Train PMO staff on this prioritization system and ensure it is consistently applied in 
day-to-day operations.
•	 Escalation process. Create a clear escalation process for addressing potential SLA breaches. 
This process should outline the steps to be taken when a service is at risk of not meeting its 
SLA targets, including who needs to be notified and what actions should be taken at each 
escalation level. Ensure all PMO staff are familiar with this process and can initiate it when 
necessary.
•	 SLA records. Maintain detailed records of all SLA-related activities and decisions. This 
recordkeeping includes logging any instances where SLAs are at risk, the actions taken to 
address these situations, and the outcomes of these actions.
•	 SLA-oriented culture. Foster a culture of SLA awareness within the PMO team. Regularly 
reinforce the importance of meeting SLA commitments and recognize PMO team members 
who consistently achieve or exceed SLA targets. Consider implementing visual management 
techniques, such as SLA performance boards, to keep SLA commitments at the forefront of 
daily operations.
•	 Exceptions management. Be prepared to handle exceptions or special circumstances that 
may impact SLA performance. This planning might involve situations where meeting an SLA 
for one service could jeopardize performance on another or where organizational priorities 
shift unexpectedly. Develop guidelines for making informed decisions in these scenarios, 
always keeping the overall value delivery to the organization in mind.
3.	 Handling Service Requests and Inquiries
•	 Request-tracking system. Implement a robust system for tracking and managing requests 
from submission to resolution. This system should allow for the categorization of requests, 
assignment to appropriate PMO team members, and real-time status updates. Consider using 
a dedicated service management tool to integrate with other PMO systems for seamless data 
flow and reporting.

urgent requests receive timely attention. This framework should consider factors such as the 
request’s alignment with organizational priorities, potential impacts on project success, and 
the requesting customer’s role. However, be sure to maintain a balance to ensure that all 
requests receive appropriate attention.
•	 Response time. Establish clear SLAs for initial response times and resolution timeframes for 
different types of requests. Communicate these standards to customers and ensure the PMO 
team is equipped to meet them consistently. Regularly monitor and report on adherence to 
these SLAs.
•	 Extraordinary requests. Implement escalation procedures for complex or time-sensitive 
requests that cannot be resolved through standard processes. Clearly define the criteria for 
escalation and the path it should follow, ensuring that senior PMO staff or subject matter 
experts are involved when necessary.
4.	 PMO Resource Allocation and Workload Management
•	 PMO resource pool. Maintain a clear overview of the PMO resource pool. This effort includes 
understanding each team member’s skills, availability, and current workload. Regularly 
update this information to account for changes in capacity due to leave, training, or other 
commitments.
•	 Resource allocation. Develop a robust resource allocation process. This process should take 
into account the priority and complexity of different services, as well as the specific skills 
required for each task. Aim to match tasks with the most appropriate PMO team members, 
considering both their expertise and their development needs. Look for opportunities to 
assign tasks that stretch PMO team members’ abilities and contribute to their professional 
growth. This process not only enhances the PMO team’s overall capabilities but also 
contributes to job satisfaction and retention.
•	 Workload management. Implement a workload management system that allows the PMO 
to track and balance tasks across the PMO team. This system might involve using project 
management software or a custom-built dashboard. The goal is to ensure that work is 
distributed equitably and that no team member is over- or underutilized. Be prepared to 
adjust resource allocations dynamically in response to changing demands or unexpected 
events. This adjustment might involve reallocating resources from lower-priority tasks to 
address urgent needs or bringing in additional resources during peak periods.
•	 PMO team communication. Regular communication with the team is crucial for effective 
resource and workload management. Hold daily or weekly team meetings to discuss 
workloads, identify any capacity issues, and collaboratively solve resource allocation 
challenges. Encourage PMO team members to speak up if they feel overwhelmed or if they 
have the capacity to take on additional tasks.
•	 Resource utilization monitoring. Monitor resource utilization and productivity regularly. 
Look for patterns or trends that might indicate the need for additional resources, training, 
or process improvements. Use this data to inform future resource planning and to justify 
resource requests to senior management if necessary.

PMO services. This feedback could involve formal surveys, informal check-ins, or dedicated 
feedback sessions. Act on this feedback promptly, demonstrating the PMO’s responsiveness 
and commitment to continuous improvement.
•	 Trusted advisor role. Establish the PMO team members as trusted advisors to key customers. 
This effort involves not just delivering services but also providing insights, recommendations, 
and strategic guidance. Look for opportunities to add value beyond the scope of defined 
services, such as sharing industry trends or good practices.
•	 Expectation management. Manage customer expectations effectively. Be clear about what 
the PMO can and cannot do and be transparent about any limitations or challenges in service 
delivery. If issues arise, communicate them promptly, along with a plan for resolution.
•	 Collaboration culture. Foster a culture of collaboration among the PMO and its customers. 
Encourage customers to view the PMO as a partner in achieving project and organizational goals. 
This collaborative approach can lead to more effective service delivery and greater overall impact.
6.	 PMO Risk and Issue Management
•	 Risk management framework. Develop a comprehensive risk management framework 
for PMO services. This framework should include risk identification, assessment, mitigation, 
and monitoring processes. Regularly conduct risk assessments for each service, considering 
factors such as resource availability, technological changes, and organizational priorities.
•	 Issue management. Establish a clear process for escalating and managing issues that arise 
during service delivery. This process should include defining what constitutes an issue, how 
issues should be reported, who is responsible for addressing them, and how their resolution 
will be communicated to customers.
•	 Risk and issue log. Implement a risk and issue log to track potential threats to service 
delivery and ongoing challenges. Regularly review and update this log, ensuring that 
mitigating actions are taken and that lessons are learned from resolved issues.

Step 7: Service Monitoring
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
The service monitoring step in the value-generating PMO flywheel is essential for PMO professionals 
as it emphasizes the efficacy and efficiency of service delivery. Mastering service monitoring is 
crucial because it provides concrete evidence of the PMO’s ability to meet its commitments and 
deliver the services defined in the PMO value proposition.
For PMO professionals, effective service monitoring differentiates between service outputs and 
outcomes, offering a clear understanding of immediate results and broader impacts. This step is 
crucial for PMO professionals as it helps maintain high service standards, build customer trust, 
and drive PMO processes and maturity improvement, reinforcing the PMO’s value within the 
organization.
Service Monitoring Step at a Glance
Service monitoring in the PMO context is a critical process that provides real-time insights into 
service delivery effectiveness and efficiency. This systematic approach to tracking, measuring, and 
evaluating PMO services against predetermined standards ensures that the PMO consistently meets 
or exceeds its commitments to PMO customers (see Figure 20-1).
At its core, service monitoring focuses on the tangible outputs of PMO services, providing concrete 
evidence of performance. By regularly tracking KPIs and compliance with SLAs, this process helps 
ensure consistency and quality in service delivery. Service monitoring serves as an early warning 
system, allowing for the identification of potential issues before they escalate into significant 
problems.
The data gathered through service monitoring enables informed, real-time decision-making 
about resource allocation and service refinement. This data-driven approach not only enhances 
operational efficiency but also demonstrates the PMO’s commitment to accountability and 
continuous improvement. By consistently meeting or exceeding performance targets, the PMO 
builds credibility and trust with customers across the organization.
In essence, service monitoring acts as the pulse of PMO performance, providing vital signs that 
indicate the health and efficiency of PMO services. This step transforms abstract concepts of quality 
and efficiency into measurable metrics, offering a clear picture of the PMO’s immediate impact and 
value. By maintaining this constant vigilance on service performance, the PMO positions itself as

a reliable, high-performing entity capable of adapting to changing organizational demands and 
consistently delivering value.
Tracking the effectiveness of services provided by a PMO is essential to help ensure these services 
are delivered efficiently and are meeting the intended standards, processes, SLAs, and PMO 
customer expectations.
The SLAs establish specific performance benchmarks that the PMO commits to achieving, making 
them a critical framework for both setting and measuring service expectations. However, it is 
important to distinguish between two types of performance indicators in this context: those 
focused on service delivery and those centered on outcomes. While outcome-based indicators 
evaluate the ultimate value or impact generated by a service—such as enhanced project success 
rates or ROI—indicators focused on service delivery measure the PMO’s efficiency and proficiency in 
providing the service itself, often against SLA commitments.

Step 7: Service Monitoring  203
Service delivery indicators primarily assess how well the PMO executes its services according to SLAs 
and internal standards. These indicators address questions such as:
•	 Is the service being provided consistently and on schedule?
•	 Are methodologies being followed?
•	 Are SLAs being met?
For example, in resource management, a service delivery indicator might measure the timeliness 
and accuracy of resource allocation, ensuring that skilled personnel are available where and when 
needed. While this metric does not directly measure project success or customer satisfaction, it 
does provide essential insights into the quality of the resource management process and SLA 
compliance.
Focusing on service delivery indicators tied to SLAs offers several benefits for a PMO. First, these 
indicators help identify inefficiencies or areas for improvement within the service itself. For 
instance, if the PMO’s methodology management service frequently fails to meet SLAs related 
to timeliness or consistency, it may indicate a need for refining processes, offering additional 
training, or establishing clearer guidelines. This insight allows the PMO to take corrective action 
and streamline its processes, ensuring that all services are delivered at a consistently high 
standard. Additionally, these indicators support accountability, providing concrete metrics that 
measure whether each service meets agreed-upon SLAs, reinforcing the PMO’s commitment to 
delivering reliable and efficient support.
Another significant benefit of service delivery indicators is that they establish a foundation for 
outcome-focused performance. Efficient, SLA-compliant service delivery often lays the groundwork 
for achieving desired outcomes. For instance, a PMO that meets SLA benchmarks in change 
control management (such as processing a set percentage of change requests within a specified 
timeframe) is better positioned to avoid project delays and budget overruns. This proficiency in 
service execution creates a stable environment where project outcomes are more likely to align with 
strategic goals.
In addition to service delivery indicators, PMOs also require indicators focused on outcomes, which 
provide insights into the value generated by the services over time. These outcome indicators are 
key to assessing the broader impact and alignment of services with strategic goals. These indicators 
address questions such as:
•	 Does the service improve project success rates?
•	 Are customers more satisfied with project outcomes?
•	 Has there been a measurable increase in ROI or resource utilization efficiency?
Outcomes are specifically assessed in Steps 9 and 10 of the PMO Value Ring™ framework, 
respectively known as value delivery and value recognition.
Together, SLA-focused service delivery indicators and outcome indicators offer a comprehensive 
view of PMO performance. Service delivery indicators ensure that the PMO operates efficiently

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
within established SLAs, while outcome indicators validate the PMO’s value to the organization. 
This balanced approach enables the PMO to refine its processes, consistently deliver on promises, 
and demonstrate quantifiable value, aligning more closely with the organization’s strategic goals.
Table 20-1 provides examples of indicators tailored to specific PMO services. Each indicator 
highlights the importance of objective, results-oriented metrics in demonstrating the PMO’s 
commitment to operational excellence and effective service delivery.
Organizing service delivery indicators into specific categories allows the PMO to manage day-to-day 
performance systematically, aligning each activity with defined SLA commitments. This structured 
approach creates a clear framework for monitoring and enhancing operational effectiveness, 
enabling the PMO to consistently deliver high-quality services, meet customer expectations, and 
promptly address any arising issues. The main types of service delivery indicators, organized by their 
focus and impact, include:
•	 Efficiency indicators. Efficiency indicators ensure that resources, such as time, budget, and 
personnel, are used effectively in delivering PMO services. By tracking metrics like time taken to 
complete tasks, budget adherence, and resource utilization, the PMO can identify bottlenecks 
and optimize processes to meet SLA requirements for resource use, ensuring services are 
delivered on schedule and within budget.

organization from risks and help ensure that all service delivery practices align with necessary 
standards, which is crucial for operational integrity.
•	 Productivity indicators. Productivity indicators evaluate how effectively PMO team members 
complete tasks associated with service delivery. By tracking task completion rates, output per 
hour, and the number of deliverables produced, the PMO can optimize workflows and ensure 
team members meet productivity targets specified in SLAs. This helps the PMO meet service 
delivery expectations within set timelines.
•	 Satisfaction indicators. Satisfaction indicators capture customer perceptions of PMO service 
delivery, providing insights into whether the services meet delivery expectations outlined in 
SLAs. Using tools like satisfaction surveys, service feedback, and ratings on service quality, the 
PMO can make adjustments to better align with satisfaction standards, ensuring customers are 
consistently pleased with the service.
•	 Timeliness indicators. Timeliness indicators measure the PMO’s responsiveness and speed in 
delivering services, meeting the SLA commitments related to response times and deadlines. 
Metrics like response time, issue resolution time, and the percentage of projects completed on 
schedule can help the PMO to maintain consistent, prompt delivery as expected in the SLA.
•	 Adaptability indicators. Adaptability indicators evaluate the PMO’s ability to respond to 
changing requirements while staying within the SLA. Tracking metrics like successful change 
implementation rates, time to reallocate resources, and flexibility in priority adjustments, 
the PMO can help ensure it meets changing needs without compromising service quality or 
timeliness.
•	 Communication indicators. Communication indicators monitor the clarity, transparency, 
and frequency of communication between the PMO and customers, as specified in the 
SLA. These indicators track metrics such as the frequency of updates, clarity of reports, and 
customer feedback on communication effectiveness, ensuring customers remain informed 
and aligned.
•	 Risk management indicators. Risk management indicators assess the PMO’s ability to identify, 
evaluate, and mitigate risks in service delivery, maintaining service stability in line with SLAs. 
Tracking metrics like frequency of risk assessments, percentage of mitigated risks, and customer 
confidence in risk management practices can help prevent disruptions and ensure a stable and 
reliable service.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
Implementing the Service Monitoring Step
1.	 Establishing a Comprehensive PMO Service Monitoring Framework
•	 Service performance measurement process. Develop a standardized data-collection and 
analysis methodology. This process might involve implementing automated tracking systems, 
creating custom reporting tools, or integrating existing project management software 
with monitoring capabilities. The goal is to establish a consistent and reliable method for 
gathering performance data across all PMO services.
•	 Service performance dashboard. Create a centralized dashboard or reporting system that 
provides real-time visibility into service performance. This dashboard should offer both high-
level overviews and the ability to drill down into specific services or metrics. Consider using 
data-visualization techniques to make the information easily digestible and actionable.
•	 Monitoring schedule. Develop a schedule for regular monitoring activities. This schedule 
may include daily checks of critical metrics, weekly performance reviews, and monthly 
comprehensive analyses. The frequency of monitoring should be tailored to the nature of 
each service and the requirements should be specified in the SLAs.
•	 PMO team roles and responsibilities. Establish clear roles and responsibilities within the 
PMO team for monitoring activities. This process includes designating individuals responsible 
for data collection, analysis, and reporting for each service. Provide training to ensure that all 
team members understand the monitoring framework and their roles within it.
2.	 Managing SLA Compliance
•	 SLA compliance system. Implement a system for tracking SLA compliance. This system 
should provide visibility into how current performance compares to SLA goals. Consider 
using a traffic light system (red, amber, green) to quickly highlight services that are meeting, 
at risk of breaching, or already breaching their SLAs.
•	 SLA performance review process. Establish a process for regular SLA performance reviews. 
This process may involve weekly checks of all SLAs and more in-depth monthly reviews. During 
these reviews, assess not only whether SLAs are being met but also how close performance is 
to the agreed goals. Look for trends that could indicate future compliance issues.
•	 SLA breaches. Develop a clear escalation process for addressing SLA breaches or near 
misses. This process should outline the steps to be taken when a service is at risk of not 
meeting its SLA, including who needs to be notified and what actions should be taken. 
Ensure this process is well documented and understood by all PMO team members.
•	 SLA noncompliance documentation. Create a system for documenting all instances of 
SLA noncompliance, including the circumstances that led to the breaches, actions taken to 
address them, and measures implemented to prevent recurrences. This documentation is 
crucial for demonstrating accountability and informing future improvement efforts.
•	 SLA reviews. Periodically review the relevance and appropriateness of existing SLAs. As 
organizational needs and PMO capabilities evolve, some SLAs may need to be adjusted.

Step 7: Service Monitoring  207
Use the insights gained from ongoing monitoring to inform these reviews and negotiate any 
necessary changes to SLA terms.
•	 Service development. Ensure that learnings from SLA reviews feed back into the service 
development step. Insights gained about realistic performance targets, changing customer 
needs, or emerging service priorities should inform the ongoing evolution of PMO services.
3.	 SLA Performance Reporting and Communication
•	 Performance reporting. Regularly communicate SLA performance to PMO customers. This 
communication may include monthly or quarterly SLA compliance reports that provide 
clear overviews of performance against all SLAs. Be transparent about any breaches or 
challenges faced and use these communications as opportunities to demonstrate the PMO’s 
commitment to meeting its service commitments.
•	 Reporting schedule. Establish a regular reporting schedule that aligns with organizational 
rhythms and decision-making cycles. This reporting schedule might involve daily 
performance snapshots, weekly summary reports, monthly detailed analyses, and quarterly 
strategic reviews. Ensure that the frequency and depth of reporting is appropriate for each 
PMO customer group.
•	 Reporting content. Implement data visualization techniques to make monitoring results 
more accessible and impactful. Use charts, graphs, and infographics to highlight key trends, 
comparisons, and performance against targets. Consider using interactive dashboards 
that allow PMO customers to explore the data themselves. Develop a clear and consistent 
narrative around the monitoring results. This narrative should explain what the data means, 
why it matters, and what actions are being taken as a result. Use this narrative to reinforce the 
link between service performance and organizational value.
•	 Reporting channels. Establish multiple channels for communicating monitoring results. 
These channels may include email reports, presentations in management meetings, updates 
on internal collaboration platforms, or dedicated performance review sessions. Tailor the 
communication method to the preferences and needs of different PMO customer groups.
4.	 Gathering and Analyzing PMO Customer Feedback
•	 Customer satisfaction measurement. Develop a standardized set of questions or metrics 
for measuring PMO customer satisfaction across different services. This standardized 
measurement will help ensure consistency in feedback collection and allow for meaningful 
comparisons over time and between services.
•	 Customer feedback collection. Implement a system for collecting and analyzing PMO 
customer feedback. This system may involve using survey tools that provide instant 
notifications of low satisfaction scores or negative comments, allowing for quick follow-up 
and resolution of issues.
•	 Customer feedback analysis. Regularly analyze the feedback collected to identify

Step 8: Service Improvement
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
The service improvement step of the value-generating PMO flywheel is critical for PMO professionals 
as it directly enhances the PMO’s ability to deliver value to PMO customers and the organization. 
This step focuses on increasing the maturity of PMO services, enabling PMO professionals to elevate 
PMO offerings from basic functions to sophisticated services. As services mature, they significantly 
increase the likelihood of achieving desired outcomes and delivering effective value.
This maturity enhancement is crucial for PMO professionals aiming to transition from operational 
efficiency to value impact. Service improvement allows PMO professionals to develop services 
that not only meet current needs but also anticipate future challenges, positioning the PMO as a 
proactive, value-driving entity.
The focus on service maturity provides PMO professionals with a structured approach to continuous 
improvement, enabling them to quantifiably demonstrate the evolution of PMO services over 
time. This tangible progress in PMO service sophistication and effectiveness serves as compelling 
evidence of the PMO’s growing value, strengthening its position within the organization and 
securing ongoing support and resources for further development and impact.
Service Improvement at a Glance
The service improvement step is a structured approach aimed at enhancing the maturity, effectiveness, 
and overall value generated by PMO services. This step in the value-generating PMO flywheel 
emphasizes a continuous cycle of assessing current service maturity levels, identifying key areas for 
evolution, and implementing targeted improvements to elevate service maturity (see Figure 21-1).
Service improvement involves a continuous cycle of assessment, planning, implementation, and 
review. Key aspects include analyzing data, gathering customer feedback, benchmarking against 
industry standards, and leveraging emerging practices in PMOs.
The improvement process may involve refining existing services, developing new services, or 
retiring obsolete ones. The refinement of services often requires cross-functional collaboration 
within the organization and may necessitate changes in processes, tools, or skills. Successful service 
improvement results in more sophisticated PMO services that are better aligned with organizational 
strategy, more efficient in their execution, and more effective in delivering expected outcomes.

Implementing the Service Improvement Step
1.	 Conducting a Comprehensive PMO Service Maturity Assessment
•	 PMO service maturity assessment. Evaluate each PMO service’s current maturity level 
using a clear PMO maturity model. Define specific criteria for each level of maturity in 
the model. Assess each service against these criteria to determine its current state. Note 
that organizational maturity models and PMO maturity models are different instruments: 
The former measures the organization’s maturity in portfolio, program, and project 
management, while the latter measures the maturity level of each PMO service in terms of 
the sophistication with which it is provided. Appendix X3 in this guide offers a PMO Service 
Maturity Assessment, a comprehensive model for evaluating the maturity of the 26 most 
common PMO services.

Step 8: Service Improvement  213
•	 PMO service maturity reporting. Document the assessment findings in a comprehensive 
report, including detailed analyses of each service and overall PMO maturity. This report will 
serve as a baseline for measuring future progress and as a foundation for developing the 
service improvement roadmap.
2.	 Analyzing Maturity Gaps and PMO Service Improvement Opportunities
•	 PMO service maturity gap analysis. Conduct a gap analysis comparing the current maturity 
state with the desired future state. This gap analysis will help identify the most critical areas 
for improvement and inform the prioritization of enhancement initiatives. This activity 
involves a deep dive into the assessment results to understand the root causes of maturity 
gaps and identify the most impactful areas for enhancement. When defining the desired 
maturity levels, consider both the immediate needs of the organization and long-term 
strategic objectives.
•	 Identify and detail improvement opportunities. Analyze the identified gaps and pinpoint 
specific improvement opportunities. Prioritize the improvement opportunities based on 
multiple factors. Consider the potential impact on service effectiveness, alignment with PMO 
customer needs, alignment with organizational strategy, complexity of implementation, 
and resource requirements. Analyze the interdependencies among different services and 
improvement opportunities. Some enhancements may have cascading effects, positively 
impacting multiple services or maturity dimensions. Identifying these synergies can help in 
developing a more efficient improvement strategy.
•	 Quick wins. Look for quick wins—improvements that can be implemented rapidly and with 
minimal resources while still providing noticeable benefits. These opportunities can help 
build momentum and demonstrate early value from the improvement process.
•	 Feasibility analysis. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis for each major improvement 
opportunity. Estimate the resources required for implementation and the potential benefits 
in terms of increased efficiency, effectiveness, and value delivery. This analysis will be crucial 
in building a business case for improvement initiatives.
•	 Reporting the maturity improvement proposal. Document the findings of this analysis in a 
detailed report, including prioritized improvement opportunities, their potential impacts, and 
recommendations for addressing them. This report will serve as a key input for developing 
the service improvement roadmap.
3.	 Developing a PMO Service Improvement Roadmap
•	 Setting objectives and goals. Set clear, measurable objectives for each service improvement 
initiative and directly link the objectives to the goals of increasing value delivery. Align these 
objectives with the overall PMO goals.
•	 Phased implementation approach. Develop a phased approach to implementing 
improvements. Begin with quick wins that can demonstrate immediate value, followed by

medium-term enhancements and long-term transformational changes. This phased approach 
helps manage resources effectively and maintains momentum throughout the improvement 
journey.
•	 Implementation timeline. Create a detailed timeline for each phase of the improvement 
process. Include key milestones, deliverables, and decision points. Consider using Gantt 
charts or other project management tools to visualize this timeline and the dependencies 
among different initiatives.
•	 Ownership and responsibilities. Assign clear ownership and responsibilities for each 
improvement initiative. Identify who will be responsible for leading each initiative, who needs 
to be involved, and who should be kept informed. This clarity in roles and responsibilities is 
crucial for successful implementation.
•	 Resource planning. Develop resource plans for each improvement initiative. This includes 
estimating required budgets, personnel, technology, and other resources needed for 
successful implementation. Ensure that these resource requirements are realistic and aligned 
with organizational constraints.
•	 Overall PMO maturity. Integrate plans for enhancing the PMO’s implementation of the 
PMO Value Ring™ framework into the overall improvement roadmap. This planning can help 
ensure a holistic approach to PMO maturity enhancement.
4.	 Implementing PMO Service Enhancement Initiatives
•	 Implementation team. Establish an implementation team or task force responsible for 
driving the enhancement initiatives. This team should have a mix of skills including project 
management, change management, and specific expertise related to the services being 
improved. Ensure this team has the necessary authority and resources to effectively lead the 
implementation efforts.
•	 Implementation plans. Develop detailed implementation plans for each enhancement 
initiative. These plans should break down the improvement process into specific tasks, assign 
responsibilities, set timelines, and identify key dependencies. Use project management 
methodologies to structure these plans, ensuring all aspects of implementation are 
considered. Implement a rolling planning process for service improvement while maintaining 
a long-term vision, focusing on detailed planning for the near term (e.g., the next 
3–6 months) and developing broader, more flexible plans for the longer term.
•	 Pilot approach. Start with pilot implementations where appropriate. This approach allows 
for testing and refining enhancements in a controlled environment before full-scale rollout. 
Select pilot groups that are representative of the broader user base and can provide valuable 
feedback.
•	 Change management. Implement a robust change management strategy to support 
the adoption of enhanced services. This strategy includes developing a comprehensive 
communications management plan to keep all customers informed about the changes, their

benefits, and their potential impacts. Conduct training sessions to ensure users are prepared 
for new or modified processes and tools.
•	 Be flexible. Build flexibility and adaptability into the implementation. While it is important 
to have a clear plan, also recognize that priorities may shift and new opportunities may 
emerge. Include regular review points where the roadmap can be reassessed and adjusted if 
necessary.
•	 Implementation progress metrics. Establish clear metrics for tracking implementation 
progress. These metrics should include both process metrics (e.g., milestones achieved, 
tasks completed) and outcome metrics (e.g., improvements in service performance and user 
satisfaction). Regularly monitor these metrics and report progress to customers.
•	 Risk management. Manage risks proactively throughout the implementation process. 
Regularly reassess potential risks and develop mitigation strategies. Be prepared to quickly 
address any issues that arise during implementation to minimize disruption to ongoing PMO 
operations.
5.	 Managing Feedback and Lessons Learned
•	 Customer feedback. Create feedback mechanisms to gather insights from PMO customers 
throughout the implementation process. This process may include regular check-ins, surveys, 
or feedback sessions. Use this input to make real-time adjustments to the implementation 
approach as needed.
•	 Lessons learned. Document lessons learned throughout the implementation process. 
Regularly review what is working well and what can be improved in the implementation 
approach. Use these insights to refine future enhancement initiatives and contribute to the 
PMO’s overall knowledge base.
6.	 Transitioning to PMO Service Operations or Onboarding
•	 Define clear transition criteria. Establish explicit criteria for when and how to transition 
from the service improvement phase to ongoing service operations. This clarity helps ensure 
that everyone understands the benchmarks that signify readiness for operation or the need 
for further onboarding.
•	 Develop a transition plan. Create a comprehensive transition plan that outlines the 
processes and responsibilities for handovers from the implementation team to the operations 
team. This plan should detail timelines, key activities, and communication strategies to 
facilitate a seamless handover.
•	 Maintain continuous support and monitoring. Implement continuous support 
mechanisms and monitoring practices to ensure the enhanced services integrate successfully 
into daily operations. Ongoing support helps address any issues promptly and maintains 
service quality.

Furthermore, the insights gained from value-delivery-step assessments provide a foundation for 
data-driven decision-making and service refinement. Ultimately, excelling in value delivery positions 
PMO professionals as indispensable contributors to organizational success, elevating their status 
and influence within the organization.
Value Delivery Step at a Glance
The value delivery step in the PMO context is the process of realizing and demonstrating the 
tangible benefits that PMO services provide to organizations. This step involves identifying specific, 
measurable metrics that showcase the PMO’s impact on expected outcomes and organizational 
success (see Figure 22-1).
PMO professionals should balance short-term wins with long-term strategic improvements, 
consistently tracking and reporting on value delivery over time. This process also involves 
establishing clear baselines for comparison and leveraging insights for continuous improvement of 
PMO services.
Ultimately, the value delivery step serves as a bridge between PMO services and organizational

Figure 22-1. Value Delivery Step in the PMO Flywheel
The value delivery step is dedicated to measuring the tangible outcomes that demonstrate the 
PMO’s value. This step focuses on evaluating whether the PMO is successfully delivering on the 
specific outcomes promised to the organization. The outcomes should be aligned with PMO 
customer needs and the organization’s strategic goals, and each outcome should represent a direct, 
measurable impact that the PMO contributes toward achieving these goals.
Indicators used in the value delivery step are inherently tangible and results-oriented, as they 
track the degree to which the PMO has achieved predefined benefits and goals. These metrics are 
essential because they provide concrete evidence of the PMO’s efficiency and enable the PMO to 
communicate its impact in terms that resonate with executive leadership and other customers. 
For instance, indicators might include metrics such as increased project success rates, reduced 
operational costs, optimized resource allocation, or accelerated project timelines. These results

Step 9: Value Delivery  223
can be quantified and linked directly to the PMO’s influence, making them essential tools for 
demonstrating the PMO’s contributions.
While this step focuses on tangible outcomes, it does not ignore qualitative elements, as these can 
enhance the story of value delivered. For instance, a higher project success rate is often a tangible 
metric, but underlying factors like improved project team collaboration or project stakeholder 
satisfaction can provide valuable context, supporting the interpretation of the PMO’s impact on 
these outcomes. Although these qualitative aspects may appear in value recognition (Step 10), they 
still add depth to the assessment of value delivery, helping the PMO to highlight not only what was 
achieved but also the supporting factors that contributed to those achievements.
In this sense, the value delivery step sets a foundation for the next step—value recognition—by 
providing a measurable baseline of results. Once the PMO has established these tangible outcomes, 
it is better positioned to move into Step 10, where the focus shifts toward understanding how these 
outcomes meet PMO customers’ expectations and fulfill their perceived needs. Although value 
delivery centers on quantifiable impact, this step acknowledges that both tangible and intangible 
indicators play a role in capturing the full picture of value creation.
Value delivery indicators demonstrate the PMO’s effectiveness in achieving expected outcomes, 
with each type of indicator in this step providing concrete, measurable insights into the PMO’s 
contributions and capturing its impact through direct results. While customer satisfaction indicators 
are often associated with perception (measured in Step 10), in Step 9 they serve to measure direct 
satisfaction with the specific outcomes delivered. This distinction is essential, as satisfaction here is 
closely tied to the tangible, measurable delivery of promised results, rather than to a broader, more 
subjective recognition of the value emphasized in Step 10.
Table 22-1 provides examples of value delivery indicators tailored to specific PMO outcomes. Each 
indicator underscores the PMO’s effectiveness in delivering quantifiable results, allowing it to 
demonstrate its value through clear, objective data.
By categorizing indicators related to value delivery, the PMO can systematically assess how well 
it achieves concrete, measurable outcomes. This structured approach provides clear metrics for 
evaluating the PMO’s effectiveness in delivering tangible results. The most common types of 
indicators for the value delivery step that emphasize the tangible achievement of outcomes include:
•	 Performance impact indicators. These indicators capture the PMO’s direct influence on 
improving program and project success, measuring adherence to scope, schedule, and 
budget. For instance, project success rates, on-time completion percentages, and budget-
adherence rates reveal the PMO’s effectiveness in helping projects meet critical performance 
targets, providing stakeholders with measurable evidence of reliability and consistency.
•	 Operational efficiency indicators. Operational efficiency indicators assess the PMO’s ability 
to streamline processes, reduce waste, and enhance project cycle efficiency. Metrics such as 
reduced project cycle times, improved resource utilization rates, and minimization of rework 
show how the PMO helps optimize operations, directly contributing to smoother, faster 
project completion and improving workflow efficiency.

•	 Cost management indicators. These indicators measure the PMO’s impact on cost control 
and savings, focusing on budget adherence and resource allocation efficiency. Metrics like 
cost savings from optimized resources, reduction in budget overruns, and cost avoidance 
through risk management highlight the PMO’s role in maintaining financial discipline and 
maximizing resource use, ensuring that projects stay within financial expectations and deliver 
value without excess spending.
•	 Risk mitigation indicators. Risk mitigation indicators reflect the PMO’s success in 
identifying, assessing, and reducing project risks. By tracking the reduction in high-impact 
risks, percentage of risks mitigated before affecting project outcomes, and frequency 
of unplanned project disruptions, these indicators illustrate the PMO’s proactive role in 
maintaining project stability and predictability, ensuring that potential challenges are 
addressed before they can impact success.
•	 Resource optimization indicators. These indicators measure how effectively the PMO 
allocates and utilizes resources, ensuring the right talent and tools are in place across 
projects. Metrics such as resource allocation efficiency, percentage of projects staffed 
optimally, and improvements in skill-utilization rates demonstrate how the PMO strategically 
deploys resources to maximize their impact, minimizing resource conflicts and ensuring 
project teams are adequately supported.
•	 PMO customer satisfaction indicators. In Step 9, customer satisfaction indicators 
measure direct satisfaction with specific outcomes achieved by the PMO. Examples include 
satisfaction ratings related to delivery quality, feedback on the timeliness of project support, 
contributions to the executive decision-making process, and ratings on cost management 
success. Satisfaction indicators in this step specifically reflect PMO customer satisfaction

with the outcome delivery itself, not general perceptions of value. This distinction is crucial 
because it separates concrete satisfaction with results from the broader recognition of impact 
on PMO customer needs, which is the focus of Step 10, value recognition.
•	 Strategic alignment indicators. Strategic alignment indicators assess how closely the PMO’s 
outcomes support organizational goals and priorities. Metrics like the percentage of projects 
contributing to strategic objectives, alignment scores for key initiatives, and frequency of 
strategic goal attainment underscore the PMO’s role in ensuring that projects deliver results 
aligned with the organization’s vision, reinforcing its strategic relevance.
Implementing the Value Delivery Step
1.	 Establishing a Comprehensive Value Measurement Framework
•	 Outcomes review. Review the expected outcomes for each PMO service, as defined in the 
SLAs and customer expectations gathered during earlier steps. Develop a set of specific, 
measurable indicators for each outcome. These indicators should be directly tied to 
organizational goals and portfolio, program, or project success metrics.
•	 Data collection method. Create a detailed methodology for data collection, ensuring 
consistency and reliability across different PMO services. Focus on quantitative metrics, such 
as cost savings, time reduction, or increased productivity.
•	 Value-delivered reporting. Design a standardized reporting format that clearly presents 
the value delivered, making it easy for customers to understand the PMO’s impact. This 
reporting might include dashboards, scorecards, or detailed reports tailored to different 
audience needs. Establish a regular cadence for data collection and reporting, aligning with 
organizational reporting cycles where possible.
2.	 Conducting Quantitative Impact Analysis
•	 Data collection. Collect quantitative data to determine the tangible impact of PMO services. 
Conduct financial impact assessments, translating PMO contributions into monetary terms 
wherever possible.
•	 Trend analysis. Perform trend analyses to identify patterns in value delivery across different 
services, project types, or organizational units. Look for areas of consistent high performance 
as well as potential improvement opportunities.
•	 Report findings. Create detailed reports summarizing findings, including visualizations that 
make the data easily understandable to various customers. Be sure to clearly articulate the 
methodology used and any assumptions made in the analysis.
3.	 Evaluating PMO Customers’ Expected Benefits Realization
•	 Revisit expectations. Revisit the PMO customers’ expectations and desired outcomes 
identified during earlier steps of the framework. Create a comprehensive list of expected 
outcomes for each PMO customer group and key PMO customers.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
•	 Tracking process. Develop a process for tracking a PMO customer’s expected benefits 
realization, monitoring progress toward expected outcomes over time. This process might 
involve creating individual benefit profiles for each expected outcome, detailing the 
metrics used to measure the outcome, the timeline for realization, and any dependencies or 
assumptions.
•	 Establish baselines. Conduct before-and-after analyses for major PMO interventions or 
service implementations. This analysis involves establishing clear baselines before the PMO’s 
involvement and then measuring the changes in relevant metrics after a sufficient period of 
time has passed.
•	 Case studies. Use case studies to deeply examine specific instances of high-value delivery. 
This methodology involves selecting representative cases, conducting in-depth analyses 
of the value delivered, and documenting the processes and factors that contributed to 
success.
•	 Benefits reporting. Regularly synthesize and report on the overall benefits delivered to 
PMO customers. This reporting may involve creating customer value scorecards, developing 
detailed benefits realization reports, or presenting case studies that showcase significant 
value-delivery instances.
4.	 Synthesizing and Communicating PMO Value Delivery Results
•	 Collect data. Gather all relevant data from the various value-delivery activities, including 
quantitative analyses, strategic assessments, customer benefit evaluations, and audit results.
•	 Value narrative. Develop a comprehensive narrative that tells the story of the PMO’s 
value delivery. This narrative should go beyond just presenting data to explaining how 
PMO services have contributed to project success, strategic goal achievement, and overall 
organizational performance.
•	 Communication materials. Create a suite of communication materials tailored to different 
stakeholder groups. These materials may include executive summaries for senior leadership, 
detailed technical reports for project managers, and visually engaging presentations for 
broader organizational communication.
•	 Data visualization. Use data-visualization techniques to make complex value-delivery 
information easily understandable. This effort may involve creating infographics, interactive 
dashboards, or video presentations that highlight key value metrics and trends.
•	 Reporting schedule. Develop a regular reporting schedule that aligns with organizational 
rhythms and decision-making cycles. This reporting schedule may include monthly value 
delivery updates, quarterly in-depth reviews, and annual comprehensive value reports.
•	 Communication strategy. Implement a multichannel communication strategy to ensure 
wide dissemination of value-delivery results. This strategy may include email newsletters, 
intranet posts, town hall presentations, and one-on-one briefings with customers.

Step 9: Value Delivery  227
•	 Future priorities. Communicate the value-delivery results to gather input on future PMO 
priorities and services. Encourage stakeholders to share their perspectives on where the PMO 
can deliver even greater value in the future, creating a feedback loop that informs ongoing 
PMO strategy and service development.
5.	 Iterative Refinement and Process Realignment
•	 Value gap analysis. This critical activity involves analyzing the value-delivery results 
against initial expectations and, if necessary, revisiting earlier steps in the PMO Value 
Ring™ framework to ensure alignment and maximize value delivery. Begin by conducting 
a comprehensive gap analysis between the expected outcomes defined in the value 
proposition step and the actual results measured during the value delivery step.
•	 Root cause identification. For each significant discrepancy identified, perform a root cause 
analysis to understand why the expected outcomes were not achieved. This analysis may 
involve reviewing the initial assumptions made during the value proposition step, reassessing 
the service design from the service development step, or examining the implementation 
process from the service operation step.
•	 Action plan development. Based on the insights gained, develop action plans for refining 
various elements developed in the previous steps. This may include:
•	
Value proposition step. Adjust the PMO value proposition to better align with realistic 
outcomes and evolving organizational needs.
•	
Service development step. Redesign specific PMO services to deliver the expected 
value more effectively.
•	
Service delivery step. Modify service delivery processes to address identified 
bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
•	 Improving metrics. Refine the metrics and measurement approaches used in the value 
delivery step to more accurately capture the PMO’s impact. Prioritize these refinement 
actions based on their potential impact on value delivery and the resources required for 
implementation.
•	 Change management. Establish a formal change management process for implementing 
these refinements. This process should include a clear communications management plan 
to inform all customers about the changes, training programs to support new processes or 
service designs, and feedback mechanisms to monitor the impact of the changes.
•	 Continuous improvement. Use the insights gained from this process to inform continuous 
learning and improvement within the PMO team. Conduct lessons learned sessions to 
capture key takeaways from each iteration and use these insights to refine the overall PMO 
strategy and approach to value delivery.

Looking Ahead to the Next Section
This section explored the value delivery step of the value-generating PMO flywheel, helping PMO 
professionals to achieve and showcase the tangible benefits of PMO services. However, delivering 
value is just one part of the equation; ensuring that this value is recognized and appreciated by PMO 
customers and the wider organization is equally important.
The final step of the flywheel focuses on value recognition—the process of ensuring PMO 
contributions are acknowledged and valued. The next section explores strategies for 
communicating PMO achievements; fostering a culture that appreciates project management 
excellence; and building strong, value-oriented relationships with stakeholders. By mastering this 
step, PMO professionals can solidify their roles as essential partners in organizational success.

Step 10: Value Recognition
Why This Section Matters to PMO Professionals
The value recognition step is critical for PMO professionals as it directly impacts the PMO’s perceived 
worth and sustainability within the organization. This step focuses on ensuring that PMO customers 
not only receive value but also recognize and appreciate it.
For PMO professionals, mastering value recognition is essential for maintaining customer support, 
justifying resources, and driving continuous improvement. The value recognition step provides 
insights into how well the PMO’s efforts align with customer expectations and organizational goals. 
By understanding and influencing value perception, PMO professionals can better tailor their 
services, communicate their impact more effectively, and strengthen their strategic position within 
the organization.
This step also helps in identifying any gaps between delivered value and perceived value, allowing 
for targeted improvements in service delivery or communication strategies.
Ultimately, effective value recognition enhances the PMO’s credibility, secures ongoing support, and 
ensures that the PMO remains a valued and integral part of the organization’s success strategy.
Value Recognition at a Glance
Value recognition in the PMO context is a critical process that goes beyond the mere delivery of 
services. Value recognition focuses on ensuring that PMO customers receive benefits from the 
PMO and fully acknowledge, appreciate, and internalize these benefits. This step is about bridging 
the gap between the actual value delivered and the perceived value, making it a crucial link in the 
value-generating PMO flywheel (see Figure 23-1).
This step is important because it can transform tangible outcomes into recognized 
organizational assets. While the value delivery step (Step 9) focuses on producing measurable 
results, value recognition ensures that these results are recognized and valued by PMO 
customers. This recognition is vital for the PMO’s long-term sustainability and growth within the 
organization.
Value recognition connects closely with other steps in the PMO Value Ring™ framework. This step 
builds upon the foundations laid in the awareness building (Step 1) and needs assessment (Step 2)

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
phases, ensuring that the initial promises and identified needs are not just met but recognized. 
This step also complements the value proposition (Step 3), service development (Step 4), and value 
delivery (Step 9) steps, acting as a validation mechanism for the PMO’s efforts.
Moreover, effective value recognition sets the stage for a more impactful awareness-building 
phase in the next cycle. When customers recognize and appreciate the PMO’s value, they become 
more receptive to future awareness campaigns and more likely to engage with the PMO services 
proactively.
Value recognition fosters a culture that values project management excellence by creating a shared 
understanding and appreciation of the PMO’s role in organizational success. This cultural shift can 
lead to increased support for PMO initiatives, better resource allocation, and a stronger strategic 
position for the PMO within the organization.

Step 10: Value Recognition  233
Ultimately, effective value recognition acts as a catalyst, propelling the value-generating PMO 
flywheel forward. This step reinforces the PMO’s relevance, justifies its existence and resource 
allocation, and provides the momentum needed to begin the next cycle of value creation with 
renewed energy and customer buy-in. This continuous cycle of delivery, recognition, and renewed 
engagement is key to the PMO’s ongoing evolution and its ability to consistently align with and 
contribute to organizational objectives.
In the previous step, value delivery, the PMO’s primary objective is to measure and communicate 
tangible outcomes that reflect its ability to meet predefined goals. Indicators in that step are 
predominantly quantitative and results-focused, aimed at providing concrete, measurable evidence 
of the PMO’s effectiveness in delivering on specific outcomes.
In contrast, value recognition shifts focus from quantitative outcomes to the “perceived value” the 
PMO brings to its customers. While the previous step demonstrates what the PMO has achieved in 
concrete terms, this step explores how these achievements are understood, valued, and appreciated 
by those whom the PMO serves. The indicators in this step are largely qualitative, centering on 
PMO customer satisfaction, alignment with strategic goals, and the PMO’s reputation for reliability. 
Metrics here might include customer satisfaction ratings, feedback on the PMO’s strategic relevance, 
and testimonials from executive leadership. These are inherently subjective measures that capture 
how PMO customers feel about the PMO’s contributions, adding a layer of trust, credibility, and 
relational depth that goes beyond objective outcomes.
While Step 9, value delivery, is evidence-oriented, providing PMO customers with objective 
performance measures and focusing on the PMO’s ability to meet specified targets (thus directly 
answering questions like “Has the PMO achieved its goals?”), Step 10, value recognition, is 
perception-oriented, offering insights into how these results are received and appreciated, and 
addressing a different set of questions such as: “Do PMO customers feel that the PMO is a valuable 
partner?”
Value recognition shows how well the PMO’s impact resonates on both relational and reputational 
levels, and solidifies the PMO’s reputation by emphasizing customer trust, satisfaction, and 
alignment with the organization’s vision. In this way, this step becomes essential for building long-
term loyalty and securing executive support, as it reflects the PMO’s value beyond raw numbers.
Together, the value delivery and value recognition steps provide a holistic view of the PMO’s 
contributions. Value delivery gives the PMO a solid foundation of quantitative results, proving that 
it meets targets. Value recognition adds depth to this foundation, showing that beyond achieving 
goals, the PMO also cultivates a strong, positive presence within the organization. By addressing 
both the measurable outcomes and the perceived value of its services, the PMO can not only 
validate its success but also reinforce its importance, trustworthiness, and customer focus.
Table 23-1 provides examples of value recognition indicators tailored to specific PMO outcomes. 
Each indicator highlights the importance of PMO customer feedback and perception in capturing 
the full scope of the value of a PMO.
In addition to indicators tied to specific outcomes, value recognition can also include “general 
indicators” that capture a broader view of the PMO’s reputation and perceived value within the

organization. These indicators go beyond measuring success in individual areas, focusing instead 
on the PMO’s overall impact as a strategic and trusted partner. By assessing these high-level 
perceptions, the PMO can gain insights into its general standing with customers, its alignment with 
organizational strategies, and its contributions to long-term goals.
The following are examples of general-value-recognition indicators that reflect the PMO’s broader 
influence and reputation:
•	 Net Promoter Score℠ (NPS®) for the PMO.1 The NPS® measures the likelihood that PMO 
customers would recommend the PMO’s services to others. This indicator captures overall 
satisfaction and loyalty, reflecting the PMO’s standing within the organization.
•	 General trust level in the PMO. This indicator assesses the degree of trust that executive 
leaders and other key customers place in the PMO’s ability to deliver valuable, reliable services. 
This indicator is essential for understanding the PMO’s credibility and reputation across the 
organization.
•	 Perception of the PMO as a strategic partner. This indicator evaluates whether customers see 
the PMO as aligned with the organization’s long-term goals and as a critical player in achieving

PMO’s perceived value as a critical organizational asset.
While all indicators in this step focus on perception and customer satisfaction, grouping them into 
distinct categories highlights the different facets of the PMO’s relationships with its customers and 
its perceived impact within organizations. By categorizing these indicators, the PMO can collect 
more focused feedback, gaining deeper insights into specific areas of its reputation and customer 
experience. Some possible categories for value recognition indicators include:
•	 Delivery satisfaction indicators. These indicators capture customer perceptions of the quality 
of results delivered by the PMO. For instance, the satisfaction level regarding the quality of 
completed projects can be assessed.
•	 Strategic alignment indicators. These indicators assess how well the PMO’s efforts are 
perceived to align with organizational strategic goals. For instance, the executives’ perceptions of 
the PMO’s contribution to achieving organizational objectives can be assessed.
•	 Trust and credibility indicators. These indicators measure the trust that customers place in 
the PMO, reflecting its reliability and reputation. For instance, the customers’ confidence in the

Implementing the Value Recognition Step
1.	 Conducting PMO Customer Value Perception Surveys
•	 Survey design and analysis. Develop a comprehensive survey covering various PMO 
value aspects. Include both quantitative rating scales and open-ended questions to capture 
nuanced feedback. Ensure the survey design allows for segmentation of responses by 
customer group to identify any variations in value perception. Analyze the survey results 
thoroughly, looking for patterns, trends, and any discrepancies between expected and 
perceived value.
•	 Survey reporting. Prepare detailed reports of the findings, including visualizations that 
make the data easily digestible for different audiences. Use these insights to inform future 
PMO strategies, service improvements, and communication plans. Consider implementing 
a longitudinal approach, repeating the survey at regular intervals to track changes in value 
perception over time. Pay special attention to areas where there is a significant gap between 
delivered value (as measured in the previous step) and perceived value. Any gaps can 
highlight communication issues or misalignments in expectations.
•	 Customer engagement. Use the survey process itself as a tool for engagement and 
value recognition. The act of seeking feedback demonstrates the PMO’s commitment to 
customer satisfaction and continuous improvement. Follow up with participants to share 
key findings and action plans, reinforcing the message that their input is valued and acted 
upon. This comprehensive approach to customer-value-perception surveys provides a solid 
foundation for understanding how well the PMO’s efforts are recognized and appreciated 
across the organization, setting the stage for targeted improvements and enhanced value 
recognition.
2.	 Facilitating PMO Value Recognition Workshops
•	 Interactive workshops. Organize and facilitate interactive workshops designed to explore 
and enhance customers’ recognition of PMO value. These workshops should bring together 
diverse groups of customers to discuss and reflect on the PMO’s contributions. Start by 
carefully planning the workshop structure, including activities that encourage open 
dialogue, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving. Begin each workshop with a 
brief presentation of key PMO achievements and metrics to set the context. Then engage 
participants in exercises such as value mapping, where they visually represent how PMO 
services connect to organizational outcomes.

Step 10: Value Recognition  237
•	 Insights documentation. Document all insights, suggestions, and feedback meticulously. After 
the workshop, synthesize the information gathered and share a summary with participants 
and other relevant customers. Use the workshop outcomes to inform PMO strategy, service 
development, and communication plans. Consider making these workshops a regular event, 
perhaps quarterly or biannually, to maintain an ongoing dialogue about PMO value.
•	 Post-workshop engagement. Follow up with participants after the workshop to see how 
their perceptions or actions have changed. This post-workshop engagement can reinforce 
the workshop’s impact and provide additional data on its effectiveness in enhancing value 
recognition. These interactive sessions not only gather valuable insights but also serve to 
reinforce and expand customers’ recognition of PMO value, creating a shared understanding 
and appreciation of the PMO’s role in organizational success.
3.	 Developing and Maintaining a PMO Value Recognition Dashboard
•	 Value recognition dashboard. Create a dynamic, visual dashboard that consolidates and 
displays key indicators of PMO value recognition. Begin by identifying the most crucial 
metrics that reflect how well PMO value is recognized across the organization. These metrics 
might include customer satisfaction scores, utilization rates of PMO services, number of 
requests for PMO involvement in new initiatives, or mentions of PMO contributions in 
executive communications. Design the dashboard to be visually appealing and easily 
understandable, using charts, graphs, and infographics to represent data.
•	 Dashboard accessibility. Make the dashboard easily accessible to PMO team members and 
customers, perhaps through a dedicated intranet page or regular email updates. Use the 
dashboard in PMO team meetings to guide discussions on value recognition strategies and 
in stakeholder meetings to demonstrate the PMO’s impact. Regularly review and refine the 
dashboard based on feedback and changing organizational priorities.
•	 Customized dashboards. Consider creating customized views of the dashboard for different 
customer groups, highlighting the metrics most relevant to their interests. This customization 
can increase engagement and relevance for various users. Implement a feature that allows 
customers to input their own observations or feedback directly into the dashboard, creating a 
more interactive and inclusive tool.
•	 Provide visibility of the PMO. Create a “value story of the month” feature on the dashboard, 
highlighting a specific example of PMO impact. This engagement opportunity can help bring 
the metrics to life and reinforce the tangible benefits of PMO services. Implement alerts 
or notifications for significant changes in key metrics, ensuring that the PMO can respond 
quickly to shifts in value perception.
•	 Gamification approach. Consider gamification elements, such as departmental competitions or 
individual recognition for high engagement with PMO services, to encourage active participation 
in value-creating activities. Finally, use the dashboard as a learning tool, incorporating 
explanations of metrics and their significance to educate customers about different aspects 
of PMO value. This value recognition dashboard serves as a powerful tool for monitoring, 
communicating, and enhancing the recognition of PMO value across the organization, providing 
a central point of reference for all value-related discussions and decisions.

4.	 Conducting PMO Value Storytelling Campaigns
•	 Storytelling campaigns. Develop and execute comprehensive storytelling campaigns 
that bring the PMO’s value to life through compelling narratives. Start by collecting a 
diverse range of stories that illustrate the PMO’s impact across different customers, projects, 
departments, and organizational goals. Train PMO team members in effective storytelling 
techniques, focusing on how to structure narratives that resonate with different audiences. 
Create a variety of storytelling formats, such as written case studies, video testimonials, 
podcasts, or infographic journey maps.
•	 Storytelling content calendar. Develop a content calendar that ensures a steady stream 
of fresh stories across various communication channels. Collaborate with the marketing 
or communications department to enhance these stories’ production quality and reach. 
Encourage customers to share their own stories of PMO value, providing them with templates 
or guidelines to ensure consistency.
•	 Storytelling events. Leverage, for example, the globally recognized International PMO 
Day, which is celebrated on the second Tuesday of May each year, to organize storytelling 
events such as a “PMO Impact Day,” where successes are shared through presentations and 
interactive displays. Integrate these stories into regular organizational communications, such 
as newsletters, town hall meetings, or the company intranet. Create a searchable repository 
of PMO success stories that customers can easily access and reference.
•	 Storytelling campaign measurement. Measure the impact of the storytelling campaign 
through metrics like story engagement rates, changes in PMO service requests, or 
improvements in value perception surveys. Use these insights to continuously refine the 
storytelling approach, focusing on the types of stories and formats that resonate most 
strongly with audiences. This storytelling-campaign approach makes PMO value tangible and 
relatable, enhancing recognition across the organization through the power of narrative and 
personal connection.
5.	 Implementing a 360-Degree PMO Value Feedback System
•	 Feedback process. Develop and implement a comprehensive feedback process that captures 
insights on PMO value from all angles within the organization. Start by mapping out all 
touchpoints between the PMO and various customers, from project initiation to closure and 
beyond. Create a range of feedback mechanisms tailored to different interaction types and 
customer preferences. These feedback mechanisms may include quick pulse surveys after 
specific PMO interactions, in-depth interviews at project milestones, online feedback forms 
accessible through the PMO portal, and AI-powered chatbots for gathering real-time feedback.
•	 Identifying trends. Use the feedback to identify trends in value perception, uncover hidden 
pain points, and highlight areas of exceptional value delivery. Implement a closed-loop 
system where customers are informed about how their feedback has been used to enhance 
PMO services or processes. Regularly review and refine the feedback system itself, ensuring it 
remains user-friendly and relevant.

Step 10: Value Recognition  239
•	 Feedback forums. Organize regular ”feedback forums” where customers can discuss their 
experiences with the PMO in a facilitated group setting. These sessions can uncover collective 
insights and foster a shared understanding of PMO value. Develop a system of “value alerts” 
that notifies PMO leadership of significant positive or negative feedback, allowing for rapid 
responses to critical issues or opportunities.
6.	 Organizing PMO Value Recognition Events
•	 PMO value recognition events. Plan and execute a series of events specifically designed 
to showcase and celebrate the value delivered by the PMO. Organize smaller, more frequent 
events like monthly “PMO Value Spotlight” sessions where specific PMO successes are 
presented to relevant stakeholders. These sessions can be informal, perhaps over lunch 
or as part of regular team meetings, to maintain ongoing awareness of PMO value. Create 
interactive showcase events where customers can explore PMO tools, methodologies, and 
success stories through hands-on demonstrations and displays. This type of ”PMO Value Expo” 
could feature booths highlighting different aspects of PMO value, interactive technology 
demonstrations, and mini workshops on PMO services.
•	 Spreading PMO value recognition within the organization. Develop a “PMO Value 
Roadshow” that travels to different departments or locations, tailoring the presentation 
of PMO value to each specific audience. This mobile approach ensures that all parts of the 
organization, regardless of location, have the opportunity to engage with and recognize 
PMO value. Incorporate elements of gamification or competition into these events to boost 
engagement, such as a “PMO Value Challenge,” where teams compete to demonstrate their 
understanding and application of PMO principles.
•	 External collaboration. Invite external speakers or industry experts to these events to 
provide perspective on the PMO’s value relative to industry standards. This external validation 
can significantly enhance the credibility of the PMO’s value proposition. Use these events 
as opportunities to gather additional feedback on PMO value perception, perhaps through 
interactive polling or feedback walls. This real-time input can provide valuable insights and 
demonstrate the PMO’s commitment to customer opinions.
•	 Executive engagement. Ensure high-level executive participation in these events to 
underscore the organizational importance of the PMO. Consider having executives share 
their perspectives on how the PMO has contributed to strategic objectives. Document these 
events through videos, photos, and written summaries, and share these materials widely to 
extend the reach of the value recognition message beyond the immediate attendees.
•	 Impact measurement. Measure the impact of these events through attendance rates, 
engagement levels, and follow-up surveys on PMO value perception. Use these metrics to 
continuously refine and improve the events, ensuring they remain effective tools for value 
recognition. These recognition events serve not only to celebrate PMO achievements but 
also to reinforce and expand the recognition of PMO value across the organization, creating a 
culture of appreciation for project management excellence.

PMO Customer 
Expectation Assessment
Building on the customer-centric approach, this section presents a powerful resource for PMO 
professionals: a curated list of 30 potential PMO outcomes. This comprehensive list has emerged 
from extensive research within the global PMO community, encompassing PMOs from diverse 
regions and industries. The insights gathered represent a broad spectrum of experiences, 
challenges, and good practices observed across various organizational contexts.
The outcomes listed have been distilled from interactions with PMO leaders, project managers, and 
stakeholders from multinational corporations, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and 
small- to medium-sized enterprises. This diverse sample ensures that the list captures a wide range 
of potential needs and pain points that PMOs might encounter, regardless of their specific industry 
or geographical location.
Each outcome in the list is meticulously structured to provide maximum utility:
•	 The “evidence of need” highlights signs or symptoms suggesting a customer may grapple with 
challenges in a specific area. This information empowers PMO professionals to identify potential 
pain points proactively.
•	 The “how to question the customer” section provides thoughtfully designed questions that serve 
as conversation starters. These questions enable PMO professionals to delve deeper into the 
customers’ needs, challenges, and expectations.
•	 The “recommended services” section is derived from a comprehensive analysis of the most 
common PMO services implemented globally. This analysis draws upon the collective 
experiences and insights of the diverse, international PMO community.
This comprehensive list of potential outcomes serves as a versatile tool for PMO professionals. 
The list offers a structured approach to needs assessment, ensuring no critical areas are overlooked. 
This approach aids in prioritizing PMO services based on the most urgent customer needs and helps 
align PMO services with specific outcomes.

By understanding which services have the greatest potential to generate the desired outcome, 
PMOs can make informed decisions about where to focus their resources and efforts. This targeted 
approach allows for more efficient and effective PMO operations, ensuring that the services 
implemented are those most likely to address the customers’ most pressing needs and deliver 
tangible value.
Moreover, this alignment between outcomes and services facilitates a more strategic approach to 
PMO design and operation. This approach enables PMOs to build a service portfolio that is directly 
tied to organizational needs and expected outcomes rather than implementing services based on 
generic PMO models or assumptions.
The inclusion of recommended services transforms this list from a diagnostic tool into a 
comprehensive guide for PMO development and optimization. The recommended services bridge 
the gap between identifying needs and implementing solutions, providing PMO professionals with 
a roadmap for creating high-impact, customer-centric PMO operations tailored to their unique 
organizational contexts.
The assessment includes 30 outcomes, all carefully structured to offer maximum utility when 
interviewing or surveying PMO customers to identify their top priorities and needs.

Appendix X3
PMO Service Maturity Assessment
The PMO service maturity assessment is designed to be a practical tool for assessing current 
capabilities, identifying areas for improvement, and guiding PMO development. Organizations can 
effectively use this model for:
1.	 Assessment. Begin by assessing the PMO’s current service maturity level across each dimension. 
This assessment involves gathering data through surveys, interviews, and performance metrics 
to determine where the PMO stands in relation to the defined service maturity levels.
2.	 Gap analysis. Identify gaps between the current service maturity level and the desired level for 
each dimension. The desired level should be determined based on organizational needs and 
strategic objectives, recognizing that the highest maturity level may not always be necessary or 
appropriate for every dimension.
3.	 Prioritization. Based on the gap analysis, prioritize areas for improvement. Consider both the 
size of the gap and the potential impact on organizational performance when setting priorities.
4.	 Action planning. Develop detailed action plans for increasing service maturity levels in ­priority 
areas. These plans should include specific initiatives, resource requirements, timelines, and 
­success metrics.
5.	 Implementation. Execute the action plans, ensuring proper change management practices are 
in place to support the transition.
6.	 Monitoring and adjustment. Regularly monitor progress and be prepared to adjust plans as 
needed. PMO service maturity development is an ongoing process, and flexibility is key to long-
term success.
7.	 Reassessment. Periodically reassess the PMO’s service maturity levels to track progress and 
identify new areas for improvement.

Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
This comprehensive assessment outlines the 26 most common PMO services and their five levels 
of maturity. Each maturity level reflects increasing complexity, capability, and impacts on value 
generation for overall organizational success. Understanding these services and their progression 
helps PMO professionals to strategically enhance their PMOs, ensuring they deliver maximum value 
and align with evolving business objectives.
This assessment should be used as an instrument for applying Step 8 of the value-generating PMO 
flywheel, which is part of the PMO Value Ring™ framework. More details on this step can be found in 
Section 21 on service improvement.
To calculate the PMO service maturity, follow these steps:
1.	 Identify the services. List all of the strategic, tactical, and operational services provided by the 
PMO.
2.	 Assign points. Assign a maturity score based on predefined criteria for each service. The scoring 
system might range from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating low maturity and 5 indicating high maturity.
3.	 Sum the scores.
•	 Strategic services. Add the points obtained for all of the strategic services.
•	 Tactical services. Add the points obtained for all of the tactical services.
•	 Operational services. Add the points obtained for all of the operational services.
4.	 Calculate the total possible points.
•	 Strategic services. Multiply the number of strategic services by the highest possible score 
(i.e., 5).
•	 Tactical services. Multiply the number of tactical services by the highest possible score.
•	 Operational services. Multiply the number of operational services by the highest possible 
score.
5.	 Compute the maturity percentages.
•	 Strategic maturity percentage. (Sum of strategic services points / total possible strategic 
points) × 100
•	 Tactical maturity percentage. (Sum of tactical services points / total possible tactical points) 
× 100
•	 Operational maturity percentage. (Sum of operational services points / total possible 
operational points) × 100
These percentages provide a clear view of the maturity levels across the strategic, tactical, and 
operational dimensions of the PMO, helping to identify areas for improvement.

Appendix X3  277
PMO Service Maturity Assessment
Strategic Services
1.	 Advice to Executive Level
•	 Level 1—Reactive advisory. Advice is provided only when explicitly requested by 
executives. It is often based on limited information and may not align consistently with 
organizational strategy. The PMO lacks a proactive approach and does not offer unsolicited 
insights, potentially missing opportunities to add value.
•	 Level 2—Structured consultation. The PMO implements scheduled consultations with 
executives, providing more consistent advice. These sessions follow a basic structure but the 
advice may still lack depth or comprehensive data backing. While more regular, the advice 
might not fully integrate all aspects of portfolio, program, and project management.
•	 Level 3—Data-driven guidance. The PMO leverages robust data analytics to provide 
insights. Advice becomes proactive based on trends identified in portfolio, program, and 
project performance data. There is a clear link between the advice given and organizational 
objectives, with recommendations supported by concrete evidence.
•	 Level 4—Strategic integration. The PMO’s advice becomes a key input in strategic decision-
making. There is a bidirectional flow of information, with the PMO both informing and being 
informed by organizational strategy. Scenario planning and predictive analytics are used to 
provide forward-looking advice, enabling executives to make more informed decisions.
•	 Level 5—Transformational leadership. The PMO is seen as a strategic partner, actively 
shaping organizational strategy through its advice. The guidance provided leads to 
transformational changes in how the organization approaches portfolios, programs, and 
projects. Advanced techniques like artificial intelligence and machine learning are used to 
provide predictive and prescriptive advice, positioning the PMO as an industry thought leader.
2.	 Benefits Realization Management
•	 Level 1—Ad hoc tracking. The PMO identifies potential benefits for portfolios and programs, 
but there is no structured process for tracking or measuring them. Benefits realization is 
largely left to chance, with little to no follow-up work performed after project completion. 
The organization has limited visibility into whether expected benefits are actually realized.
•	 Level 2—Structured monitoring. The PMO establishes a formal process for identifying and 
tracking benefits. There is a consistent approach to documenting expected benefits at the 
outset of programs and projects. Basic metrics are defined and monitored but the focus is 
primarily on tracking rather than active management. Some benefits may be measured after 
implementation but the process is not comprehensive.
•	 Level 3—Active management. The PMO actively manages benefits throughout the life cycle 
of portfolios and programs. Regular benefits reviews are conducted, with clear processes for 
making adjustments to ensure benefits are realized. The PMO works closely with program and 
project managers to identify risks to benefits realization and develop mitigation strategies. There 
is a strong focus on accountability, with clear ownership assigned for each expected benefit.

278 
Project Management Offices: A Practice Guide
•	 Level 4—Integrated approach. Benefits realization becomes a key factor in program and 
project selection, prioritization, and continuation decisions. The PMO provides regular 
benefits realization reports to senior management, which directly inform strategic planning. 
There is a sophisticated understanding of the interdependencies among different benefits 
across the portfolio. The organization has a clear view of how program and project benefits 
contribute to overall strategic objectives.
•	 Level 5—Continuous optimization. The PMO employs advanced analytics and artificial 
intelligence to forecast and optimize benefits realization. Sophisticated modeling techniques 
predict the likelihood of benefits realization and identify influencing factors. Complex 
scenarios are run to optimize the portfolio for maximum benefits realization. A culture of 
continuous learning exists, with insights from benefits realization feeding back into project 
selection and execution processes. The organization is recognized as a leader in benefits 
realization management.
3.	 Foster Project Culture
•	 Level 1—Basic awareness. The PMO introduces basic project management concepts to the 
organization. Outside of dedicated project teams, there is limited understanding of project 
management principles. Training and communication efforts are sporadic and lack a coherent 
strategy. The value of project management is not widely recognized across the organization.
•	 Level 2—Structured education. The PMO implements regular training sessions to improve 
project management skills across the organization. There is a structured curriculum covering 
key project management concepts. However, the focus is primarily on technical skills rather 
than fostering a broader project culture. Participation may be limited to those directly 
involved in projects.
•	 Level 3—Embedded practices. Project management principles are widely understood and 
applied across the organization beyond just project teams. The PMO promotes the use of 
project management tools and techniques in various business contexts. There is growing 
recognition of how project management contributes to organizational success. Cross-
functional collaboration in project contexts becomes more common.
•	 Level 4—Cultural alignment. Project management is seen as a core competency and 
is factored into performance evaluations across the organization. The PMO works with 
human resources to integrate project management skills into job descriptions and career 
development paths. There is a strong emphasis on continuous improvement in project 
management practices. Leadership actively champions the project management culture.
•	 Level 5—Innovative project culture. Project management culture drives innovation and 
is a key differentiator for the organization. The PMO facilitates a culture of experimentation 
and learning from both successes and failures. Advanced project management practices are 
developed internally and are often shared with the wider industry. The organization attracts 
top talent due to its strong project management culture and is seen as a benchmark by 
others.

Appendix X3  279
4.	 Governance Oversight
•	 Level 1—Basic rules. The PMO introduces basic rules for project management but they are 
not consistently followed across the organization. Governance is largely reactive, addressing 
issues as they arise. There is limited understanding of governance’s role in project success. 
Documentation of governance processes is minimal and not widely accessible.
•	 Level 2—Structured framework. The PMO establishes clear governance structures that are 
generally adhered to across portfolios, programs, and projects. Roles and responsibilities 
within the governance framework are defined. Regular governance meetings are held but 
they may focus more on reporting than decision-making. There is improved documentation 
of governance processes but it may not cover all scenarios.
•	 Level 3—Active enforcement. The PMO conducts regular audits to ensure compliance with 
governance standards. There are clear consequences for noncompliance, balanced with 
support for improvement. Governance processes are well documented and easily accessible. 
The PMO provides training on governance to ensure widespread understanding. Governance 
data is used to identify trends and areas for improvement.
•	 Level 4—Adaptive governance. The PMO regularly reviews and updates the governance 
framework to reflect changing organizational needs and lessons learned. Governance 
processes are flexible enough to accommodate different types of programs and projects 
while maintaining consistency. There is a strong focus on governance as an enabler of project 
success, not just a control mechanism. Advanced tools are used to support governance 
processes and decision-making.
•	 Level 5—Value-driven governance. Governance is seen as a value-adding activity, not 
just a control mechanism, and drives organizational performance. The PMO uses advanced 
analytics to demonstrate the link between strong governance and project success. 
Governance processes are highly efficient, minimizing bureaucracy while maximizing value. 
The organization’s governance approach is recognized as good practice in the industry and is 
often benchmarked by others.
5.	 Organizational Change Management
•	 Level 1—Reactive approach. The PMO responds to change impacts reactively, with no 
formal process in place. Change management is seen as a project-specific activity rather than 
a portfolio- or program-level concern. There is limited understanding of how changes in one 
area can impact others. Resistance to change is often high due to a lack of preparation.
•	 Level 2—Planned approach. The PMO establishes a formal change management process 
for portfolios and programs. Changes are anticipated and planned for, but not consistently 
across all initiatives. Basic change-impact assessments are conducted. There is some 
stakeholder analysis and communication planning but it may not be comprehensive. Change 
readiness is assessed at a high level.

Critical Competency Profiles for 
PMO Service Delivery
Presented in this appendix is an in-depth analysis of the most critical competencies—selected from 
the 30 core competencies identified—that are essential for the effective delivery of each of the 26 
most common PMO services. This list is based on the collective experience and insights of the global 
PMO community, reflecting the competencies that are deemed critical for the effective delivery of 
each service.
It is important to note that other competencies not listed under each service are not necessarily 
unimportant or unnecessary; rather, they were not specifically emphasized in the mapped

The purpose of this list is to serve as a practical guide for PMO professionals looking to enhance 
their skills in alignment with the services they provide. By focusing on these key competencies, 
PMO professionals can tailor their competency development efforts to areas that will have the most 
significant impact.
