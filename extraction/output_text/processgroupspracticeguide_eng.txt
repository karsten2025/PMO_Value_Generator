Preface
This practice guide provides supplementary information to the principles-based A Guide to the 
Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Seventh Edition [1].1 Usage depends on the 
individual project professional, the organization, the model selected, and how it is tailored to best 
meet the project’s desired outcomes.
In this practice guide, project management processes are organized into Process Groups and 
the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs that are tailored to meet the needs of the organization, 
stakeholders, and the project. Process Groups interact with each phase of a project life cycle. The 
number of iterations and interactions between processes varies based on the needs of the project.
For organizations and project management practitioners who wish to adopt a process-based 
approach, this practice guide will explain the basic framework based on the following five Project 
Management Process Groups:
▶	 Initiating. Those processes performed to define a new project or a new phase of an 
existing project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase.
▶	 Planning. Those processes required to establish the scope of the project, refine  
the objectives, and define the course of action required to attain the objectives that the 
project was undertaken to achieve.
▶	 Executing. Those processes performed to complete the work defined in the project 
management plan to satisfy the project requirements.
▶	 Monitoring and Controlling. Those processes required to track, review, and regulate the 
progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the plan 
are required; and initiate the corresponding changes.
▶	 Closing. Those processes performed to formally complete or close the project, phase,  
or contract.

Introduction
This practice guide describes a process-based approach to project management. The framework 
for this approach is based on the five Project Management Process Groups:
▶	 Initiating. Those processes performed to define a new project or a new phase of  
an existing project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase.
▶	 Planning. Those processes required to establish the scope of the project, refine  
the objectives, and define the course of action required to attain the objectives  
that the project was undertaken to achieve.
▶	 Executing. Those processes performed to complete the work defined in the project 
management plan to satisfy the project requirements.
▶	 Monitoring and Controlling. Those processes required to track, review, and regulate 
the progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes  
to the plan are required; and initiate the corresponding changes.
▶	 Closing. Those processes performed to formally complete or close the project, phase, 
or contract.
The Process Groups are independent of the development approach (i.e., predictive, adaptive, 
or hybrid), application area (e.g., marketing, information services, accounting, etc.), and industry 
(e.g., construction, aerospace, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, etc.). Process Groups: A Practice 
Guide provides an overview of project and development life cycles in this introduction, with a focus 
on predictive life cycles throughout, and describes the 49 processes within these five Process Groups 
along with the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs associated with those processes. 
This practice guide identifies the processes that are considered good practices on most 
projects, most of the time. Project management should be tailored to fit the needs of the project. 
There is no requirement that any particular process or practice be performed. The processes should be 
tailored for the specific project and/or organization. Specific methodology recommendations are 
outside the scope of this practice guide.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
1.1  PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project 
activities to meet project requirements. Project management is accomplished through the appropriate 
application and integration of the project management processes identified for the project.
Managing a project typically includes but is not limited to the following activities:
▶	 Identify project requirements.
▶	 Address the various needs, concerns, and expectations of stakeholders.
▶	 Establish and maintain active communication with stakeholders.
▶	 Execute the work required to deliver the project outcomes.
▶	 Manage resources.
▶	 Balance the competing project constraints, which include but are not limited to scope, 
schedule, cost, quality, resources, and risk.
Project circumstances will influence how each project management process is implemented 
and how the project constraints are prioritized.
1.1.1  IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Project management enables organizations to execute projects effectively and efficiently. Effective 
project management helps individuals, groups, and public and private organizations to:
▶	 Meet business objectives.
▶	 Satisfy stakeholder expectations.
▶	 Be more predictable.
▶	 Increase chances of success.
▶	 Deliver the right products at the right time.

Introduction
▶	 Resolve problems and issues.
▶	 Respond to risks in a timely manner.
▶	 Optimize the use of organizational resources.
▶	 Identify, recover, or terminate failing projects.
▶	 Manage constraints (e.g., scope, quality, schedule, costs, resources).
▶	 Balance the influence of constraints on the project (e.g., increased scope may increase 
cost or schedule).
▶	 Respond to rapidly evolving markets.
▶	 Manage change using a controlled process.
Poorly managed projects or the absence of project management may result in:
▶	 Missed requirements,
▶	 Missed deadlines,
▶	 Cost overruns,
▶	 Poor quality,
▶	 Rework,
▶	 Waste,
▶	 Uncontrolled expansion of the project,
▶	 Loss of reputation for the organization,
▶	 Unsatisfied stakeholders, and/or
▶	 Failure in achieving the objectives for which the project was undertaken.

1.1.2  FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS
The foundational elements that are essential for working in and understanding the discipline 
of project management are:
▶	 Project. A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. 
(See Section 1.2 for additional information.)
▶	 Program. Related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities that are managed 
in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually. 
(See Section 1.3 for additional information.)
▶	 Program management. The application of knowledge, skills, and principles to a program 
to achieve the program objectives and obtain benefits and control not available by 
managing program components individually. (See Section 1.3 for additional information.)
▶	 Portfolio. Projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to 
achieve strategic objectives. (See Section 1.4 for additional information.)
▶	 Portfolio management. The centralized management of one or more portfolios to achieve 
strategic objectives. (See Section 1.4 for additional information.)
▶	 Relationship of project, program, portfolio, and operations management. Projects 
may be managed in three separate scenarios: as a stand-alone project that is outside of a 
program or portfolio, within a program, or within a portfolio. (See Section 1.5 for additional 
information.)
▶	 Operations management. The ongoing production of goods and/or services. It ensures 
that business operations continue efficiently by using the optimal resources needed to 
meet customer demands. It is concerned with managing processes that transform inputs 
(e.g., materials, components, energy, and labor) into outputs (e.g., products, goods,  
and/or services).
Operations management is an area that is outside the scope of formal project management 
as described in this practice guide.
▶	 Operations and project management. Ongoing operations are outside of the scope of a 
project; however, there are intersecting points where the two areas cross. (See Section 1.6 
for additional information.)
▶	 Organizational project management (OPM). A framework in which portfolio, program, 
and project management are integrated with organizational enablers in order to achieve 
strategic objectives. (See Section 1.6 for additional information.)

Introduction
1.2  PROJECTS
A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. 
Projects are undertaken to fulfill objectives by producing deliverables that result in the desired 
outcomes. An objective is defined as an outcome toward which work is to be directed, a strategic 
position to be attained, a purpose to be achieved, a result to be obtained, a product to be produced, 
or a service to be performed. A deliverable is defined as any unique and verifiable product, result, 
or capability to perform a service that is required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or 
project. Deliverables may be tangible or intangible.
The temporary nature of projects indicates that a project has a definite beginning and end. 
Temporary does not necessarily mean a project has a short duration. The end of the project is 
reached when one or more of the following is true:
▶	 The project’s objectives have been achieved.
▶	 The objectives will not or cannot be met.
▶	 Funding is exhausted or no longer available for allocation to the project.
▶	 The need for the project no longer exists (e.g., the customer no longer wants the project 
completed, a change in strategy or priority ends the project, the organizational management 
provides direction to end the project).
▶	 The human or physical resources are no longer available.
▶	 The project is terminated for legal cause or convenience.
1.2.1  PROJECTS DRIVE CHANGE
Projects drive change in organizations. From a business perspective, a project is aimed at moving 
an organization from one state to another state in order to achieve a specific objective (see Figure 1-1). 
Before the project begins, the organization is commonly referred to as being in the current state. The 
desired result of the change driven by the project is described as the future state.
The successful completion of a project results in the organization moving to the future state 
and achieving the specific objective.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
1.2.2  PROJECTS ENABLE BUSINESS VALUE CREATION
PMI defines business value as the net quantifiable benefit derived from a business endeavor. 
The benefit may be tangible, intangible, or both. In business analysis, business value is considered 
the return, in the form of elements such as time, money, goods, or intangibles in return for 
something. Business value in projects refers to the benefit that the results of a specific project 
provide to its stakeholders. The benefit from projects may be tangible, intangible, or both.

Introduction
1.2.3  CONTEXTS FOR PROJECT INITIATION
Organizational leaders initiate projects in response to factors acting upon their organizations. 
Projects provide the means for organizations to successfully make the changes necessary to deal 
with these factors. There are four fundamental categories for these factors, which illustrate the 
context of a project:
▶	 Meet regulatory, legal, or social requirements;
▶	 Satisfy stakeholder requests or needs;
▶	 Create, improve, or fix products, processes, or services; and
▶	 Implement or change business or technological strategies.
These categories should map directly to the strategic objectives of the organization and projects 
will fulfill the objectives and, ultimately, deliver business value. Examples of factors that lead to the 
creation of a project are shown in Table 1-1.
Social and Environmental Impacts
It is becoming more common for initial planning to consider social and environmental impacts in 
addition to the financial impacts (sometimes referred to as the triple bottom line). This may take 
the form of a product life cycle assessment which evaluates the potential environmental impacts 
of a product, process, or system. The product life cycle considers the impacts of materials and 
processes with regard to sustainability, toxicity, and the environment.

Introduction
1.3  PROGRAMS AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
A program is defined as related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities 
managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually. 
Programs include program-related work outside the scope of the discrete projects in the program. 
Program management is the application of knowledge, skills, and principles to a program to achieve 
the program objectives and obtain benefits and control not available by managing related program 
components individually. Programs may also include work that is operational in nature.
Program management supports organizational strategies by authorizing, changing, or 
terminating projects and managing their interdependencies.
1.4  PORTFOLIOS AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
A portfolio is defined as projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed 
in a coordinated manner to achieve strategic objectives. Portfolio management is the centralized 
management of one or more portfolios to achieve strategic objectives. Portfolio management 
focuses on ensuring the portfolio is performing consistent with the organization’s objectives and 
evaluating portfolio components to optimize resource allocation. Portfolios may include work that  
is operational in nature.
1.5  RELATIONSHIP AMONG PORTFOLIOS, PROGRAMS,  
AND PROJECTS
A project may be managed in three separate scenarios: as a stand-alone project (outside a 
portfolio or program); within a program; or within a portfolio. Project management has interactions 
with portfolio and program management when a project is within a portfolio or program. Figure 1-2 
shows the relationships between portfolios and programs, between portfolios and projects, and 
between programs and individual projects. These relationships are not always hierarchical.

Table 1-2. Comparative Overview of Portfolios, Programs, and Projects
 
 
Organizational Project Management
Projects
Programs
Portfolios
A project is a temporary endeavor 
undertaken to create a unique 
product, service, or result.
Projects have deﬁned objectives.  
Scope is progressively elaborated 
throughout the project life cycle.
Project managers expect change and 
implement processes to keep change 
managed and controlled.
Project managers progressively 
elaborate high-level information into 
detailed plans throughout the project 
life cycle.
Project managers manage the project 
team to meet the project objectives.
Project managers monitor and control 
the work of producing the products, 
services, or results that the project 
was undertaken to produce.
Success is measured by product and 
project quality, timeliness, budget 
compliance, and degree of customer 
satisfaction.
A program is a group of related 
projects, subsidiary programs, and 
program activities that are managed in 
a coordinated manner to obtain 
beneﬁts not available from managing 
them individually.
Programs have a scope that 
encompasses the scopes of its 
program components. Programs 
produce beneﬁts to an organization by 
ensuring that the outputs and 
outcomes of program components are 
delivered in a coordinated and 
complementary manner.
Programs are managed in a manner 
that accepts and adapts to change as 
necessary to optimize the delivery of 
beneﬁts as the program’s components
deliver outcomes and/or outputs.
Programs are managed using 
high-level plans that track the 
interdependencies and progress of 
program components. Program plans 
are also used to guide planning at the 
component level.
Programs are managed by program 
managers who ensure that program 
beneﬁts are delivered as expected, by 
coordinating the activities of a 
program’s components.
Program managers monitor the 
progress of program components to 
ensure the overall goals, schedules, 
budget, and beneﬁts of the program 
will be met.
A program’s success is measured by 
the program’s ability to deliver its 
intended beneﬁts to an organization, 
and by the program’s efﬁciency and 
effectiveness in delivering those 
beneﬁts.
A portfolio is a collection of projects, 
programs, subsidiary portfolios, and 
operations managed as a group to 
achieve strategic objectives.
Portfolios have an organizational 
scope that changes with the strategic 
objectives of the organization.
Portfolio managers continuously 
monitor changes in the broader 
internal and external environments.
Portfolio managers create and 
maintain necessary processes and 
communication relative to the 
aggregate portfolio.
Portfolio managers may manage or 
coordinate portfolio management 
staff, or program and project staff that 
may have reporting responsibilities 
into the aggregate portfolio.
Portfolio managers monitor strategic 
changes and aggregate resource 
allocation, performance results, and 
risk of the portfolio.
Success is measured in terms of the 
aggregate investment performance 
and beneﬁt realization of the portfolio.

1.6  ORGANIZATIONAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT (OPM)
Organizational project management (OPM) is a strategy execution framework utilizing portfolio, 
program, and project management. It provides a framework that enables organizations to consistently 
and predictably deliver on organizational strategy, producing better performance; better results; and 
a sustainable, competitive advantage.
Figure 1-3 shows the organizational environment where strategy, a portfolio, programs and 
projects, and operations interact.

Introduction
1.7  PROJECT COMPONENTS AND CONSIDERATIONS
Projects comprise several key components that, when effectively managed, result in their 
successful completion. This section of the practice guide identifies and explains these components. 
The various components interrelate to one another during the management of a project.
The key components are described briefly in Table 1-3. These components are more fully 
explained in Sections 1.7.1 through 1.7.5.
Table 1-3. Description of Key Components
 
 
PMBOK ® Guide Key Component
Brief Description
The series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion.
A collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the completion of 
one or more deliverables.
A review at the end of a phase in which a decision is made to continue to the next 
phase, to continue with modiﬁcation, or to end a program or project.
A systematic series of activities directed toward causing an end result where one or 
more inputs will be acted upon to create one or more outputs.
A logical grouping of project management inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. 
The Project Management Process Groups include Initiating, Planning, Executing, 
Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. Project Management Process Groups are not

1.7.1  PROJECT AND DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLES
A project life cycle is the series of phases that a project passes through from its start to 
its completion. It provides the basic framework for managing the project. This basic framework 
applies regardless of the specific project work involved. The phases may be sequential, iterative, 
or overlapping. All projects can be mapped to the generic life cycle shown in Figure 1-4.
Project life cycles can be predictive or adaptive. Within a project life cycle, there are generally 
one or more phases that are associated with the development of the product, service, or result. 
These are called development life cycles, which can be predictive, adaptive, iterative, incremental, 
or a hybrid model:

Introduction
▶	 In a predictive life cycle, the project scope, time, 
and cost are determined in the early phases of the 
life cycle. Any changes to the scope are carefully 
managed. Predictive life cycles may also be referred 
to as waterfall life cycles.
▶	 Adaptive life cycles can be iterative, or incremental. 
The scope is outlined and agreed before the start of 
an iteration. Adaptive life cycles are also referred to 
as agile or change-driven life cycles.
▹	
In an iterative life cycle, the project scope is 
generally determined early in the project life 
cycle, but time and cost estimates are routinely 
modified as the project team’s understanding 
of the product increases. Iterations develop the 
product through a series of repeated cycles, 
while increments successively add to the 
functionality of the product.
▹	
In an incremental life cycle, the deliverable 
is produced through a series of iterations 
that successively add functionality within a 
predetermined time frame. The deliverable 
contains the necessary and sufficient 
capability to be considered complete only 
after the final iteration.
▶	 A hybrid life cycle is a combination of a predictive and 
an adaptive life cycle. Those elements of the project 
that are well known or have fixed requirements 
follow a predictive development life cycle, and those 
elements that are still evolving follow an adaptive 
development life cycle.
It is up to the project 
management team to 
determine the best  
life cycle for each project, 
based on the project’s inherent 
characteristics. The project life 
cycle needs to be flexible enough 
to deal with the variety of factors 
included in the project.
Project life cycles are independent 
of product life cycles, which  
may be produced by a project.  
A product life cycle is the series of 
phases that represent the evolution 
of a product, from concept through 
delivery, growth, maturity, and  
to retirement.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
1.7.2  PROJECT PHASE
A project phase is a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the 
completion of one or more deliverables. The phases in a life cycle can be described by a variety of 
attributes. Attributes may be measurable and unique to a specific phase. Attributes may include 
but are not limited to:
▶	 Name (e.g., Phase A, Phase B, Phase 1, Phase 2, proposal phase),
▶	 Number (e.g., three phases in the project, five phases in the project), 
▶	 Duration (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 1 quarter),
Planning is Always There
A key thing to remember about life cycles is that each life cycle shares the element of planning. 
What differentiates a life cycle is not whether planning is done, but rather how much planning is 
done, when, and by whom. Agile approaches engage the team more in planning while predictive 
approaches are driven by the project manager.
For predictive approaches, the plan drives the work. More planning is performed up front and 
requirements are identified in more detail when compared to adaptive approaches. The team 
estimates when they can deliver which deliverables and performs comprehensive procurement 
activities.
In iterative approaches, prototypes and proofs are also planned, but the outputs are intended 
to modify the plans created in the beginning. Meanwhile, incremental initiatives plan to deliver 
successive subsets of the overall project. Teams may plan several successive deliveries in advance 
or only one at a time. The deliveries inform the future project work.
Agile projects also plan. The key difference is that the team plans and replans as more information 
becomes available from review of frequent deliveries. Regardless of the project life cycle, the 
project requires planning.

▶	 Exit criteria for a project to complete a phase (e.g., documented approvals, completed 
documents, completed deliverables).
Projects may be separated into distinct phases or subcomponents. These phases or 
subcomponents are generally given names that indicate the type of work done in that phase. 
Examples of phase names include but are not limited to:
▶	 Concept development,
▶	 Feasibility study,
▶	 Customer requirements,
▶	 Solution development,
▶	 Design,
▶	 Prototype,
▶	 Build,
▶	 Test,
▶	 Transition,
▶	 Commissioning,
▶	 Milestone review, and
▶	 Lessons learned.

1.7.3  PHASE GATE
A phase gate (or review) is held at the end of a phase. The project’s performance and progress 
are compared to project and business documents including but not limited to:
▶	 Project business case,
▶	 Project charter,
▶	 Project management plan, and
▶	 Benefits management plan.
Establishing Project Phases
The project phases may be established based on various factors including but not limited to:
▶	 Management needs;
▶	 Nature of the project;
▶	 Unique characteristics of the organization, industry, or technology;
▶	 Project elements including, but not limited to, technology, engineering, business, process,  
or legal; and
▶	 Decision points (e.g., funding, project go/no-go, and milestone review).
Using multiple phases may provide better insight to managing the project. It also provides an 
opportunity to assess the project performance and take necessary corrective or preventive actions 
in subsequent phases. A key component used with project phases is the phase gate or review  
(see Section 1.7.3).

Introduction
A decision (e.g., go/no-go decision) is made as a result of this comparison to:
▶	 Continue to the next phase,
▶	 Continue to the next phase with modification,
▶	 End the project,
▶	 Remain in the phase, or
▶	 Repeat the phase or elements of it.
Depending on the organization, industry, or type of work, phase gates may be referred to 
by other terms, such as phase review, stage gate, kill point, and phase entrance or phase exit. 
Organizations may use these reviews to examine other pertinent items which are beyond the scope 
of this guide, such as product-related documents or models.
1.7.4  PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESSES
The project life cycle is managed by executing a series of project management activities known 
as project management processes. There are a total of 49 processes; however, the selection of 
processes used for any given project depends on the organization and the project—more than likely, 
all processes will not be used. The outputs can be deliverables or outcomes. Outcomes are the end 
result of a process. Project management processes apply globally across industries.
Project management processes are logically linked by the outputs they produce. Processes may 
contain overlapping activities that occur throughout the project. The output of one process generally 
results in either:
▶	 An input to another process, or
▶	 A deliverable of the project or project phase.
Figure 1-5 shows an example of how inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs relate to each 
other within a process, and with other processes.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
The number of process iterations and interactions between processes varies based on the 
needs of the project. Processes generally fall into one of three categories:
▶	 Processes used once or at predefined points in the project. The processes Develop Project 
Charter and Close Project or Phase are examples.
▶	 Processes that are performed periodically as needed. The process Acquire Resources is 
performed as resources are needed. The process Conduct Procurements is performed prior 
to needing the procured item.
▶	 Processes that are performed continuously throughout the project. The process 
Define Activities may occur throughout the project life cycle, especially if the project uses 
rolling wave planning or an adaptive development approach. Many of the Monitoring and 
Controlling processes are ongoing from the start of the project, until it is closed out.
Project management is accomplished through the appropriate application and integration of 
logically grouped project management processes. While there are different ways of grouping processes, 
PMI groups processes into five categories called Process Groups (see Section 1.7.5).

Introduction
1.7.5  PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESS GROUPS
A Project Management Process Group is a logical grouping of project management processes 
to achieve specific project objectives. Process Groups are independent of project phases. Project 
management processes are grouped into the following five Project Management Process Groups:
▶	 Initiating Process Group. Those processes performed to define a new project or a new 
phase of an existing project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase.
▶	 Planning Process Group. Those processes required to establish the scope of the project, 
refine the objectives, and define the course of action required to attain the objectives that 
the project was undertaken to achieve.
▶	 Executing Process Group. Those processes performed to complete the work defined in the 
project management plan to satisfy the project requirements.
▶	 Monitoring and Controlling Process Group. Those processes required to track, review, and 
regulate the progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes 
to the plan are required; and initiate the corresponding changes.
▶	 Closing Process Group. Those processes performed to formally complete or close the project, 
phase, or contract.
Process flow diagrams are used throughout this practice guide. The project management 
processes are linked by specific inputs and outputs where the result or outcome of one process may 
become the input to another process that is not necessarily in the same Process Group. Note that 
Process Groups are not the same as project phases.
Table 1-4 provides a list of the 49 processes mapped to their respective Process Groups. The 
numbers refer to the section numbers in this practice guide.

Introduction
1.8  PROJECT MANAGEMENT DATA AND INFORMATION
Throughout the life cycle of a project, a significant amount of data is collected, analyzed, and 
transformed. Project data are collected as a result of various processes and are shared within the 
project team. The collected data are analyzed in context, aggregated, and transformed to become 
project information during various processes. Information is communicated verbally or stored and 
distributed in various formats as reports.
Figure 1-6 shows the flow of project information across the various processes used in managing 
a project.
Key Terminology Regarding Project Data and Information
Project data are regularly collected and analyzed throughout the project life cycle. The following 
definitions identify key terminology regarding project data and information:
▶	 Work performance data. The raw observations and measurements identified during activities 
performed to carry out the project work. Examples include reported percentage of work 
physically completed, quality and technical performance measures, start and finish dates 
of schedule activities, number of change requests, number of defects, actual costs, actual 
durations, etc. Project data are usually recorded in a project management information system 
(PMIS) and in project documents.
▶	 Work performance information. The performance data collected from various controlling 
processes, analyzed in context and integrated based on relationships across areas. Examples 
of performance information are status of deliverables, implementation status for change 
requests, and forecast estimates to complete.
▶	 Work performance reports. The physical or electronic representation of work performance 
information compiled in project documents, which is intended to generate decisions or 
raise issues, actions, or awareness. Examples include status reports, memos, justifications, 
information notes, electronic dashboards, recommendations, and updates.

Introduction
1.9  TAILORING
Usually, project managers apply a project 
management methodology to their work. A methodology 
is a system of practices, techniques, procedures, and rules 
used by those who work in a discipline. Specific methodology 
recommendations are outside the scope of this practice guide.
Project management methodologies may be:
▶	 Developed by experts within the organization,
▶	 Purchased from vendors,
▶	 Obtained from professional associations, or
▶	 Acquired from government agencies.
Tailoring is the deliberate adaptation of approach, 
governance, and processes to make them more suitable for the 
given environment and the task(s) at hand.
In a project environment, tailoring includes considering 
the approaches, processes, interim deliverables, and choice 
of people to engage with. The tailoring process is driven by a 
mindset and set of values that influence the tailoring decisions. 
The project manager collaborates with the project team, 
sponsor, organizational management, or combination thereof, 
in the tailoring. In some cases, an organization may require that 
specific project management methodologies be used.
Tailoring is necessary because each project is unique. 
Not every process, tool, technique, input, or output identified 
in this practice guide is required on every project. Tailoring 
should address the competing constraints of scope, schedule, 
cost, resources, quality, and risk. The importance of each 
constraint is different for each project, and the project 
manager tailors the approach to manage these constraints 
based on the project environment, organizational culture, 
stakeholder needs, and other variables.
Sound project mana-
gement methodologies 
take into account the 
unique nature of projects and 
allow tailoring, to some extent, 
by the project manager.
Tailoring produces direct and 
indirect benefits to organizations. 
These include, but are not  
limited to:
▶	 More commitment from 
project team members who 
helped to tailor the approach,
▶	 Customer-oriented focus,  
as the needs of the customer 
are an important influencing 
factor in its development, and
▶	 More efficient use of  
project resources.

26
Process Groups: A Practice Guide
In tailoring project management, the project manager should also consider the varying levels of 
governance that may be required and within which the project will operate, as well as considering the 
culture of the organization (see Section 2.3). In addition, consideration of whether the customer of the 
project is internal or external to the organization may affect project management tailoring decisions.
The PMBOK Guide® – Seventh Edition outlines a four-step tailoring process:
▶	 Step 1: Select Initial Development Approach—This step determines the development 
approach that will be used for the project. Project teams apply their knowledge of the 
product, delivery cadence, and awareness of the available options to select the most 
appropriate development approach for the situation.
▶	 Step 2: Tailor for the Organization—While project teams own and improve their processes, 
organizations often require some level of approval and oversight. Many organizations have 
a project methodology, general management approach, or general development approach 
that is used as a starting point for their projects. Organizations that have established process 
governance need to ensure tailoring is aligned to policy. To demonstrate that the project 
team's tailoring decisions do not threaten the organization's larger strategic or stewardship 
goals, project teams may need to justify using a tailored approach.
▶	 Step 3: Tailor for the Project—Many attributes influence tailoring for the project. These 
include, but are not limited to, product/deliverable, project team, and culture. The project 
team should ask questions about each attribute to help guide them in the tailoring process. 
Answers to these questions can help identify the need to tailor processes, delivery approach, 
life cycle, tools, methods, and artifacts.
▶	 Step 4: Implement Ongoing Improvement—The process of tailoring is not a single, 
one-time exercise. During progressive elaboration, issues with how the project team is 
working, how the product or deliverable is evolving, and other learnings will indicate where 
further tailoring could bring improvements. Review points, phase gates, and retrospectives 
all provide opportunities to inspect and adapt the process, development approach, and 
delivery frequency as necessary.

Introduction
1.10  BENEFITS MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS DOCUMENTS
Projects are initiated to realize opportunities that are aligned with an organization’s strategic 
goals. Prior to initiating a project, a business case is often developed to outline the project objectives, 
the required investment, and financial and qualitative criteria for project success. The business case 
provides the basis to measure success and progress throughout the project life cycle by comparing 
the results with the objectives and the identified success criteria. The business case may be used 
before project initiation and may result in a go/no-go decision for the project.
A needs assessment often precedes the business case. The needs assessment involves 
understanding business goals and objectives, issues, and opportunities and recommending proposals 
to address them. The results of the needs assessment may be summarized in the business case 
document.
Projects are typically initiated as a result of one or more of the following strategic 
considerations:
▶	 Market demand,
▶	 Strategic opportunity/business need,
▶	 Social need,
▶	 Environmental consideration,
▶	 Customer request,
▶	 Technological advancement,
▶	 Legal or regulatory requirement, and
▶	 Existing or forecasted problem.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
A benefits management plan describes how and when the benefits of the project will be 
delivered and how they will be measured. The benefits management plan may include the following:
▶	 Target benefits. The expected tangible and intangible business value to be gained by the 
implementation of the product, service, or result.
▶	 Strategic alignment. How the project benefits support and align with the business 
strategies of the organization.
▶	 Time frame for realizing benefits. Benefits by phase: short term, long term, and ongoing.
▶	 Benefits owner. The accountable person or group that monitors, records, and reports 
realized benefits throughout the time frame established in the plan.
▶	 Metrics. The direct and indirect measurements used to show the benefits realized.
▶	 Risks. Risks associated with achieving target benefits.
The success of the project is measured against the project objectives and success criteria. 
In many cases, the success of the product, service, or result is not known until sometime after the 
project is complete. For example, an increase in market share, a decrease in operating expenses, 
or the success of a new product may not be known when the project is transitioned to operations. 
In these circumstances, the project management office (PMO), portfolio steering committee, or 
some other business function within the organization should evaluate the success at a later date to 
determine if the outcomes met the business objectives.
Development and maintenance of the project benefits management plan is an iterative activity. 
This document complements the business case, project charter, and project management plan. The 
project manager works with the sponsor to ensure that the project charter, project management 
plan, and the benefits management plan remain in alignment throughout the life cycle of the project. 
See Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide [3], The Standard for Program Management [4], 
and The Standard for Portfolio Management [5].

Introduction
A project manager needs to ensure that the project 
management approach captures the intent of business 
documents. These documents are defined in Table 1-5. These 
two documents are interdependent and iteratively developed 
and maintained throughout the life cycle of the project.
The project sponsor is generally accountable for the 
development and maintenance of the project business case 
document. The project manager is responsible for providing 
recommendations and oversight to keep the project 
business case, project management plan, project charter, 
and project benefits management plan success measures 
in alignment with one another and with the goals and 
objectives of the organization.

Both the business 
case and the benefits 
management plan are 
developed prior to the project 
being initiated. Additionally, both 
documents are referenced after 
the project has been completed. 
Therefore, they are considered 
business documents rather than 
project documents or components 
of the project management plan. 
As appropriate, these business 
documents may be inputs to 
some of the processes involved 
in managing the project, such as 
developing the project charter.

Project managers tailor the noted project management documents for their projects.  
In some organizations, the business case and benefits management plan are maintained at the 
program level. Project managers then work with the appropriate program managers to ensure the 
project management documents are aligned with the program documents. Figure 1-7 illustrates 
the interrelationship of these critical project management business documents and the needs 
assessment. Figure 1-7 shows an approximation of the life cycle of these various documents against 
the project life cycle.

Introduction
1.11  PROJECT CHARTER, PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN,  
AND PROJECT DOCUMENTS
The project charter is defined as a document issued by the project sponsor that formally 
authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply 
organizational resources to project activities.
The project management plan is defined as the document that describes how the project will be 
executed, monitored, and controlled. It integrates and consolidates all of the subsidiary management 
plans and baselines, and other information that is essential for managing the project. The individual 
aspects of the project determine which components of the project management plan are needed.
Project management plan components include but are not limited to:
▶	 Subsidiary management plans:
▹	
Scope management plan. Establishes how the scope will be defined, developed, monitored, 
controlled, and validated.
▹	
Requirements management plan. Establishes how the requirements will be analyzed, 
documented, and managed.
▹	
Schedule management plan. Establishes the criteria and the activities for developing, 
monitoring, and controlling the schedule.
▹	
Cost management plan. Establishes how the costs will be planned, structured, and controlled.
▹	
Quality management plan. Establishes how an organization´s quality policies, 
methodologies, and standards will be implemented in the project.
▹	
Resource management plan. Provides guidance on how project resources should be 
categorized, allocated, managed, and released.
▹	
Communications management plan. Establishes how, when, and by whom information 
about the project will be administered and disseminated.
▹	
Risk management plan. Establishes how the risk activities will be structured and 
performed.
▹	
Procurement management plan. Establishes how the project team will acquire goods 
and services from outside of the performing organization.
▹	
Stakeholder engagement plan. Establishes how stakeholders will be engaged in project 
decisions and execution, according to their needs, interests, and impact.

▶	 Baselines:
▹	
Scope baseline. The approved version of a scope statement, work breakdown structure 
(WBS), and its associated WBS dictionary, which can be changed using formal change 
control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison.
▹	
Schedule baseline. The approved version of a schedule model that can be changed 
using formal change control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to the 
actual results.
▹	
Cost baseline. The approved version of the time-phased project budget, excluding any 
management reserves, which can be changed using formal change control procedures 
and is used as a basis for comparison to the actual results.
▶	 Additional components. Most components of the project management plan are produced 
as outputs from other processes, though some are produced during this process. Those 
components developed as part of this process will be dependent on the project; however, 
they often include but are not limited to:
▹	
Change management plan. Describes how the change requests throughout the project 
will be formally authorized and incorporated.
▹	
Configuration management plan. Describes how the information about the items of the 
project (and which items) will be recorded and updated so that the product, service,  
or result of the project remains consistent and/or operative.
▹	
Performance measurement baseline. An integrated scope-schedule-cost plan for the project 
work against which project execution is compared to measure and manage performance.
▹	
Project life cycle. Describes the series of phases that a project passes through from its 
initiation to its closure.
▹	
Development approach. Describes the product, service, or result and development 
approach, such as a predictive, adaptive, or hybrid model.
▹	
Management reviews. Identifies the points in the project when the project manager and 
relevant stakeholders will review the project progress to determine if performance is as 
expected, or if preventive or corrective actions are necessary.

While the project management plan is one of the primary documents used to manage the 
project, other project documents are also used. These other documents are not part of the project 
management plan; however, they are necessary to manage the project effectively. Table 1-6 is a

1.12  PROJECT SUCCESS MEASURES
One of the most common challenges in project management is determining whether or not  
a project is successful.
Traditionally, the project management metrics of time, cost, scope, and quality have been the 
most important factors in defining the success of a project. More recently, practitioners and scholars 
have determined that project success should also be measured with consideration toward achievement 
of the project objectives.
Project stakeholders may have different ideas as to what the successful completion of a project 
will look like and which factors are the most important. It is critical to clearly document the project 
objectives and to select objectives that are measurable. Three questions that the key stakeholders 
and the project manager should answer are:
▶	 What does success look like for this project?
▶	 How will success be measured?
▶	 What factors may impact success?
The answer to these questions should be documented and agreed upon by the key 
stakeholders and the project manager.
Project success may include additional criteria linked to the organizational strategy and to the 
delivery of business results. These project objectives may include but are not limited to:
▶	 Completing the project benefits management plan;
▶	 Meeting the agreed-upon financial measures documented in the business case. These 
financial measures may include but are not limited to:
▹	
Net present value (NPV),
▹	
Return on investment (ROI),
▹	
Internal rate of return (IRR),
▹	
Payback period (PBP), and
▹	
Benefit-cost ratio (BCR).

▶	 Achieving other agreed-upon success measures or criteria (e.g., process throughput).
The project team needs to be able to assess the project situation, balance the demands, and 
maintain proactive communication with stakeholders in order to deliver a successful project.
When the business alignment for a project is constant, the chance for project success greatly 
increases because the project remains aligned with the strategic direction of the organization.
It is possible for a project to be successful from a scope/schedule/budget viewpoint, and to be 
unsuccessful from a business viewpoint. This can occur when there is a change in the business needs 
or the market environment before the project is completed.

The Project Environment
Projects exist and operate in environments that may have an influence on them. These influences 
can have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the project. Two major categories of influences are 
enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) and organizational process assets (OPAs).
EEFs originate from the environment outside of the project, and often outside of the enterprise. 
EEFs may have an impact at the organizational, portfolio, program, or project level.
OPAs are internal to the organization. These may arise from the organization itself, a portfolio, 
a program, another project, or a combination of these. Figure 2-1 shows the breakdown of project 
influences into EEFs and OPAs.
In addition to EEFs and OPAs, governance plays a significant role in the life cycle of the project 
(see Section 2.3).

2.1  ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
Enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) refer to conditions, not under the control of the 
project team, that influence, constrain, or direct the project. These conditions can be internal 
and/or external to the organization. EEFs are considered as inputs to many project management 
processes, specifically for most planning processes. These factors may enhance or constrain 
project management options. In addition, these factors may have a positive or negative influence 
on the outcome.
EEFs vary widely in type or nature. These factors need to be considered if the project is to be 
effective. EEFs include but are not limited to the factors described in Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.
2.1.1  EEFS INTERNAL TO THE ORGANIZATION
The following are examples of EEFs that are internal to the organization:
▶	 Organizational culture, structure, and governance. Examples include vision, mission, 
values, beliefs, cultural norms, leadership style, hierarchy and authority relationships, 
organizational style, ethics, code of conduct, policies, and procedures.
▶	 Geographic distribution of facilities and resources. Examples include factory locations 
and virtual teams.
▶	 Infrastructure. Examples include existing facilities, equipment, organizational telecom-
munications channels, information technology hardware, availability, and capacity.
▶	 Information technology software. Examples include scheduling software tools, 
configuration management systems, web interfaces to other online automated systems, 
and work authorization systems.
▶	 Resource availability. Examples include contracting and purchasing constraints, 
approved providers and subcontractors, and collaboration agreements.
▶	 Employee capability. Examples include existing human resources expertise, skills, 
competencies, and specialized knowledge.

2.1.2  EEFS EXTERNAL TO THE ORGANIZATION
The following are examples of EEFs that are external to the organization:
▶	 Marketplace conditions. Examples include competitors, market share brand recognition, 
and trademarks.
▶	 Social and cultural influences and issues. Examples include political climate, codes of 
conduct, ethics, and perceptions.
▶	 Legal restrictions. Examples include country or local laws and regulations related to security, 
data protection, business conduct, employment, and procurement.
▶	 Commercial databases. Examples include benchmarking results, standardized cost 
estimating data, industry risk study information, and risk databases.
▶	 Academic research. Examples include industry studies, publications, and benchmarking 
results.
▶	 Government or industry standards. Examples include regulatory agency regulations and 
standards related to products, production, environment, quality, and workmanship.
▶	 Financial considerations. Examples include currency exchange rates, interest rates, 
inflation rates, tariffs, and geographic location.
▶	 Physical environmental elements. Examples include working conditions, weather,  
and constraints.
2.2  ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS
Organizational process assets (OPAs) are the plans, processes, documents, templates, and 
knowledge repositories specific to and used by the performing organization. These assets influence 
the management of the project.
PMI Member benefit licensed to: Karsten Zenk - 5425687. Not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.


--- SOURCE: processgroupspracticeguide_eng.pdf | PAGE 61 ---
40
Process Groups: A Practice Guide
OPAs include any artifact, practice, or knowledge from any or all of the performing organizations 
involved in the project, which can be used to execute or govern the project. The OPAs also include the 
organization’s lessons learned from previous projects and historical information. OPAs may include 
completed schedules, risk data, and earned value data. OPAs are inputs to many project management 
processes. Since OPAs are internal to the organization, the project team members may be able to 
update and add to the organizational process assets as necessary throughout the project. They may 
be grouped into two categories:
▶	 Plans, processes, and documents. Generally, these assets are not updated as part of 
the project work and are usually established by the project management office (PMO) or 
another function outside of the project. These assets can be updated only by following 
the appropriate organizational policies. Some organizations encourage the team to tailor 
templates, life cycles, and checklists for the project. In these cases, the project team 
should tailor those assets according to the needs of the project.
▶	 Organizational knowledge repositories. These assets are updated throughout the project 
with project information. For example, information on financial performance, lessons learned, 
performance metrics and issues, and defects are continually updated throughout the project.
2.2.1  PLANS, PROCESSES, AND DOCUMENTS
The organization’s plans, processes, and documents for conducting project work include but 
are not limited to:
▶	 Initiating and Planning:
▹	
Guidelines and criteria for tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes and 
procedures to satisfy the specific needs of the project;
▹	
Product and project life cycles, and methods and procedures (e.g., project management 
methods, estimation metrics, process audits, improvement targets, checklists, and 
standardized process definitions for use in the organization);

Change control procedures, including the steps by which performing organization 
standards, plans, or any project documents will be modified and how any changes will 
be approved and validated;
▹	
Traceability matrices;
▹	
Issue and defect management processes (e.g., defining issue and defect controls, 
identifying and resolving issues and defects, and tracking action items);

▹	
Templates (e.g., risk register, issue log, and change log);
▹	
Standardized guidelines, work instructions, proposal evaluation criteria, and 
performance measurement criteria; and
▹	
Product, service, or result verification and validation processes.
▶	 Closing. Project closure guidelines or requirements (e.g., final project audits, project 
evaluations, deliverable acceptance, contract closure, resource reassignment knowledge 
transfer to production and/or operations, and lessons learned).

2.2.2  ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORIES
The organizational knowledge repositories for storing and retrieving information include but 
are not limited to:
▶	 Configuration management knowledge repositories containing the versions of software 
and hardware components and baselines of all performing organization standards, policies, 
procedures, and any project documents;
▶	 Financial data repositories containing information such as labor hours, incurred costs, 
budgets, and any project cost overruns;
▶	 Historical information and lessons learned knowledge repositories (e.g., project records 
and documents, all project closure information and documentation, information regarding 
both the results of previous project selection decisions and previous project performance 
information, and information from risk activities);
▶	 Issue and defect management data repositories containing issue and defect status, control 
information, issue and defect resolution, and action item results;
▶	 Data repositories for metrics used to collect and make available measurement data on 
processes and products; and
▶	 Project files from previous projects (e.g., scope, cost, schedule, and performance measure-
ment baselines, project calendars, project schedule network diagrams, risk registers, risk 
reports, and stakeholder registers).
2.3  GOVERNANCE
Projects operate within the constraints imposed by the organization through their structure 
and governance framework. There are various types of governance including organizational 
governance; organizational project management (OPM) governance; and portfolio, program, and 
project governance.

The Project Environment
2.3.1  ORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE
Organizational governance is a structured way to provide direction and control through 
policies and procedures to meet strategic and operational goals. Organizational governance is 
typically conducted by a board of directors to ensure accountability, fairness, and transparency to 
its stakeholders. Organizational governance principles, decisions, and procedures may influence 
and impact the governance of portfolios, programs, and projects in the following ways:
▶	 Enforces legal, regulatory, standards, and compliance requirements;
▶	 Defines ethical, social, and environmental responsibilities; and
▶	 Specifies operational, legal, and risk policies.
2.3.2  PROJECT GOVERNANCE
Project governance is the framework, functions, and procedures that guide project management 
activities in order to create a unique product, service, or result to meet organizational, strategic, and 
operational goals. Governance at the project level includes:
▶	 Guiding and overseeing the management of project work;
▶	 Ensuring adherence to policies, standards, and guidelines;
▶	 Establishing governance roles, responsibilities, and authorities;
▶	 Decision making regarding risk escalations, changes, and resources (e.g., team, financial, 
physical, facilities);
▶	 Ensuring appropriate stakeholder engagement; and
▶	 Monitoring performance.

44
Process Groups: A Practice Guide
A project governance framework provides project stakeholders with structure, procedures, roles, 
responsibilities, accountabilities, and decision-making models for managing the project. Elements  
of a project governance framework include but are not limited to principles or procedures for:
▶	 Stage gate or phase reviews;
▶	 Identifying, escalating, and resolving risks and issues;
▶	 Defining roles, responsibilities, and authorities;
▶	 Process for project knowledge management and capturing lessons learned;
▶	 Decision making, problem solving, and escalating topics that are beyond the project 
manager’s authority; and
▶	 Reviewing and approving changes to the project, and product changes that are beyond 
the authority of the project manager.
2.4  MANAGEMENT ELEMENTS
Management elements are the components that comprise the key functions or principles of 
general management in the organization. The general management elements are allocated within the 
organization according to its governance framework and the organizational structure type selected.
The key functions or principles of management include but are not limited to:
▶	 Division of work using specialized skills and availability to perform work;
▶	 Authority given to perform work;
▶	 Responsibility to perform work appropriately assigned based on such attributes as skill 
and experience;
▶	 Discipline of action (e.g., respect for authority, people, and rules);
▶	 Unity of command (e.g., only one person gives orders for any action or activity to an individual);
▶	 Unity of direction (e.g., one plan and one head for a group of activities with the same objective);
▶	 General goals of the organization take precedence over individual goals;

45
The Project Environment
▶	 Paid fairly for work performed;
▶	 Optimal use of resources;
▶	 Clear communication channels;
▶	 Right materials to the right person for the right job at the right time;
▶	 Fair and equal treatment of people in the workplace;
▶	 Clear security of work positions;
▶	 Safety of people in the workplace;
▶	 Open contribution to planning and execution by each person; and
▶	 Optimal morale.
Performance of these management elements are assigned to selected individuals within the 
organization. These individuals may perform the noted functions within various organizational 
structures. For example, in a hierarchical structure, there are horizontal and vertical levels within the 
organization. These hierarchical levels range from the line management level through to the executive 
management level. The responsibility, accountability, and authority assigned to the hierarchical level 
indicate how the individual may perform the noted function within that organizational structure.
2.5  ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES
Determination of the appropriate organizational structure type is a result of the study of trade-
offs between two key variables. The variables are the organizational structure types available for 
use and how to optimize them for a given organization. There is not a one-size-fits-all structure for 
any given organization. The final structure for a given organization is unique due to the numerous 
variables to be considered.

2.5.2  FACTORS IN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE SELECTION
Each organization considers numerous factors for establishing its organizational structure. Each 
factor may carry a different level of importance in the final analysis. The combination of the factor, its 
value, and relative importance provides the organization’s decision makers with the right information 
for inclusion in the analysis.
Factors to consider in selecting an organizational structure include but are not limited to:
▶	 Degree of alignment with organizational objectives;
▶	 Efficiency of performance;
▶	 Specialization capabilities;
▶	 Span of control, efficiency, and effectiveness;
▶	 Clear path for escalation of decisions;
▶	 Clear line and scope of authority;
▶	 Delegation capabilities;
▶	 Accountability assignment;
▶	 Responsibility assignment;
▶	 Adaptability of design;
▶	 Simplicity of design;
▶	 Cost considerations;
▶	 Physical locations (e.g., colocated, regional, and virtual); and
▶	 Clear communication (e.g., policies, status of work, and organization’s vision).

2.6  PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE
A project management office (PMO) is an organizational structure that standardizes the project-
related governance processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, and 
techniques. The responsibilities of a PMO can range from providing project management support 
functions to the direct management of one or more projects.
Types of PMOs
There are several types of PMOs in organizations. Each type varies in the degree of control and 
influence it has on projects within the organization, such as:
▶	 Supportive. Supportive PMOs provide a consultative role to projects by supplying templates, 
best practices, training, access to information, and lessons learned from other projects. This 
type of PMO serves as a project repository. The degree of control provided by the PMO is low.
▶	 Controlling. Controlling PMOs provide support and require compliance through various 
means. The degree of control provided by the PMO is moderate. Compliance may involve:
▹	
Adoption of project management frameworks or methodologies;
▹	
Use of specific templates, forms, and tools; and
▹	
Conformance to governance frameworks.
▶	 Directive. Directive PMOs take control of the projects by directly managing the projects. 
Project managers are assigned by and report to the PMO. The degree of control provided by 
the PMO is high.

--- SOURCE: processgroupspracticeguide_eng.pdf | PAGE 70 ---
49
The Project Environment
The project management office may have an organization-wide responsibility. It may play a role 
in supporting strategic alignment and delivering organizational value. The PMO integrates data and 
information from organizational strategic projects and evaluates how higher-level strategic objectives 
are being fulfilled. The PMO is the natural liaison between the organization’s portfolios, programs, 
projects, and the organizational measurement systems (e.g., balanced scorecard).
The projects supported or administered by the PMO may not be related other than by being 
managed together. The specific form, function, and structure of a PMO are dependent upon the needs 
of the organization that it supports.
A PMO may have the authority to act as an integral stakeholder and a key decision maker 
throughout the life of each project in order to keep it aligned with the business objectives. The 
PMO may:
▶	 Make recommendations,
▶	 Lead knowledge transfer,
▶	 Terminate projects, and
▶	 Take other actions, as required.
A primary function of a PMO is to support project managers in a variety of ways, which may 
include but are not limited to:
▶	 Managing shared resources across all projects administered by the PMO;
▶	 Identifying and developing project management methodology, best practices, and standards;
▶	 Coaching, mentoring, training, and oversight;
▶	 Monitoring compliance with project management standards, policies, procedures, and 
templates by means of project audits;
▶	 Developing and managing project policies, procedures, templates, and other shared 
documentation (organizational process assets); and
▶	 Coordinating communication across projects.

Role of the  
Project Manager
A project manager plays a critical role in the leadership of a project team in order to achieve 
the project’s objectives. This role is clearly visible throughout the project. Many project managers 
become involved in a project from its initiation through closing. However, in some organizations, 
a project manager may be involved in evaluation and analysis activities prior to project initiation. 
These activities may include consulting with executive and business unit leaders on ideas for 
advancing strategic objectives, improving organizational performance, or meeting customer 
needs. In some organizational settings, the project manager may also be called upon to manage 
or assist in business analysis, business case development, and aspects of portfolio management 
for a project. A project manager may also be involved in follow-on activities related to realizing 
business benefits from the project. The role of a project manager may vary from organization to 
organization. Ultimately, the project management role is tailored to fit the organization in the same 
way that the project management processes are tailored to fit the project.

Project Leadership Roles
Project manager—The person assigned by the performing organization to lead the team that  
is responsible for achieving the project objectives.
Functional manager—The functional manager focuses on providing management oversight for  
a functional or business unit.
Operations manager—Operations managers are responsible for ensuring that business operations 
are efficient.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
▶	 Project team and roles. A large project comprises many members, each playing a different 
role. A large project may have more than 100 project members led by a project manager. 
Team members may fulfill many different roles, such as design, manufacturing, and 
facilities management. They may represent multiple business units or groups within an 
organization. The project members make up each leader’s team.
▶	 Responsibility for team. The project manager is responsible for what the team 
produces—the project outcome. The project manager needs to take a holistic view of the 
team’s products in order to plan, coordinate, and complete them. This is accomplished 
by reviewing the vision, mission, and objectives of the organization to ensure alignment 
with their products. The project manager then establishes an interpretation of the vision, 
mission, and objectives involved in successfully completing their products, and uses this 
interpretation to communicate and motivate the team toward the successful completion 
of their objectives.
▶	 Knowledge and skills. The project manager is not expected to perform every role on 
the project, but should possess project management knowledge, technical knowledge, 
understanding, and experience. The project manager provides the project team 
with leadership, planning, and coordination through communications. The project 
manager provides written communications (e.g., documented plans and schedules) and 
communicates in real time with the team using meetings and verbal or nonverbal cues.
3.1  THE PROJECT MANAGER’S SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
Project managers fulfill numerous roles within their sphere of influence. These roles reflect the 
project manager’s capabilities and are representative of the value and contributions of the project 
management profession. This section highlights the roles of the project manager in the various 
spheres of influence shown in Figure 3-1.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
3.1.1  THE PROJECT
The project manager leads the project team to meet the project’s objectives and stakeholders’ 
expectations. The project manager works to balance the competing constraints on the project with 
the available resources.
The project manager also performs communication roles between the project sponsor, team 
members, and other stakeholders. This includes providing direction and presenting the vision of 
success for the project. The project manager uses soft skills (e.g., interpersonal skills and the ability 
to manage people) to balance the conflicting and competing goals of the project stakeholders 
in order to achieve consensus. In this context, consensus means that the relevant stakeholders 
support the project decisions and actions even when there is not 100% agreement.
Research shows that successful project managers consistently and effectively use certain 
essential skills. Research reveals that the top 2% of project managers, as designated by their 
bosses and team members, distinguish themselves by demonstrating superior relationship and 
communication skills while displaying a positive attitude.
The ability to communicate with stakeholders, including the team and sponsors, applies across 
multiple aspects of the project including, but not limited to the following:
▶	 Developing finely tuned skills using multiple methods (e.g., verbal, written, and nonverbal);
▶	 Creating, maintaining, and adhering to communications plans and schedules;
▶	 Communicating predictably and consistently;
▶	 Seeking to understand the project stakeholders’ communication needs (communication 
may be the only deliverable that some stakeholders receive until the project’s end product 
or service is completed);
▶	 Making communications concise, clear, complete, simple, relevant, and tailored;
▶	 Including important positive and negative news;
▶	 Incorporating feedback channels; and

55
Role of the Project Manager
▶	 Relationship skills involving the development of extensive networks of people throughout 
the project manager’s spheres of influence. These networks include formal networks 
such as organizational reporting structures. However, the informal networks that project 
managers develop, maintain, and nurture are more important. Informal networks include 
the use of established relationships with individuals such as subject matter experts 
and influential leaders. Use of these formal and informal networks allows the project 
manager to engage multiple people in solving problems and navigating the bureaucracies 
encountered in a project.
3.1.2  THE ORGANIZATION
The project manager proactively interacts with other project managers. Other independent 
projects or projects that are part of the same program may impact a project due to, but not limited 
to, the following:
▶	 Demands on the same resources,
▶	 Priorities of funding,
▶	 Receipt or distribution of deliverables, and
▶	 Alignment of project goals and objectives with those of the organization.
Interacting with other project managers helps to create a positive influence for fulfilling the 
various needs of the project. These needs may be in the form of human, technical, or financial 
resources and deliverables required by the team for project completion. The project manager seeks 
ways to develop relationships that assist the team in achieving the goals and objectives of the project.
In addition, the project manager maintains a strong advocacy role within the organization. The 
project manager proactively interacts with managers within the organization throughout the project. 
The project manager also works with the project sponsor to address internal political and strategic 
issues that may impact the team or the viability or quality of the project.

--- SOURCE: processgroupspracticeguide_eng.pdf | PAGE 77 ---
56
Process Groups: A Practice Guide
The project manager may work toward increasing the project management competency and 
capability within the organization as a whole and is involved in both tacit and explicit knowledge 
transfer or integration initiatives. The project manager also works to:
▶	 Demonstrate the value of project management,
▶	 Increase acceptance of project management in the organization, and
▶	 Advance the efficacy of the PMO when one exists in the organization.
Depending on the organizational structure, a project manager may report to a functional 
manager. In other cases, a project manager may be one of several project managers who report to a 
PMO or a portfolio or program manager who is ultimately responsible for one or more organization-
wide projects. The project manager works closely with all relevant managers to achieve the project 
objectives and to ensure the project management plan aligns with the portfolio or program plan. 
The project manager also works closely and in collaboration with other roles, such as organizational 
managers, subject matter experts, and those involved with business analysis. In some situations,  
the project manager may be an external consultant placed in a temporary management role.
3.1.3  THE INDUSTRY
The project manager stays informed about current industry trends. The project manager takes 
this information and sees how it may impact or apply to the current projects. These trends include 
but are not limited to:
▶	 Product and technology development;
▶	 New and changing market niches;
▶	 Standards (e.g., project management, quality management, information security management);

Role of the Project Manager
3.1.4  PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS
A stakeholder is an individual, group, or organization that may affect, be affected by, or 
perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project. Project stakeholders 
may be internal or external to the project, and they may be actively involved, passively involved, or 
unaware of the project. Project stakeholders may have a positive or negative impact on the project, 
or they may be positively or negatively impacted by the project. Examples of stakeholders include 
but are not limited to:
▶	 Internal stakeholders:
▹	
Sponsor,
▹	
Resource manager,
▹	
Project management office (PMO),
▹	
Portfolio steering committee,
▹	
Program manager,
▹	
Project managers of other projects, and
▹	
Team members.
▶	 External stakeholders:
▹	
Customers,
▹	
End users,
▹	
Suppliers,
▹	
Shareholders,
▹	
Regulatory bodies, and
▹	
Competitors.
Stakeholder involvement may range from occasional contributions in surveys and focus 
groups to full project sponsorship that includes the provision of financial, political, or other types 
of support. The type and level of project involvement can change over the course of the project’s 
life cycle. Therefore, successfully identifying, analyzing, and engaging stakeholders and effectively 
managing their project expectations and participation throughout the project life cycle is critical  
to project success.

3.2  PROJECT MANAGER COMPETENCES
Recent PMI studies applied the Project Manager Competency Development (PMCD) Framework [6] to 
the skills needed by project managers through the use of the PMI Talent Triangle® shown in Figure 3-2. 
The Talent Triangle focuses on three key skill sets: Ways of Working, Business Acumen, and Power Skills.

Role of the Project Manager
3.2.1  WAYS OF WORKING
It is important for project managers to master diverse and creative ways of getting the job 
done. Project managers should understand and adopt many ways of working, including predictive, 
agile, design thinking, or other new practices still to be developed. This will allow individuals to 
quickly shift their way of working as new challenges arise. This enables success when the right 
solutions at the right moment in time are applied.
3.2.2  BUSINESS ACUMEN
Business acumen is the ability to make good judgments and quick decisions while understanding 
the many factors of influence across an organization or industry. Professionals at every level should 
actively develop business acumen, whether through experience, training, courses, certifications, or 
self-guided learning, to achieve the highest level of success. This enables a deeper knowledge of how 
any project aligns with the broader organizational strategy and global trends, enabling efficient and 
effective decision making.
3.2.3  POWER SKILLS
Beyond the traditional top-down leadership skills, power skills (formerly known as “soft skills”) 
are the critical interpersonal skills of professionals at every level that enable them to apply influence, 
inspire change, and build relationships. Power skills include collaborative leadership skills, communi-
cation skills, having an innovative mindset, having a for-purpose orientation, and exercising empathy. 
Mastering these power skills allows professionals to be powerful, influential stakeholders who can 
instigate change and make ideas a reality.

3.3  QUALITIES AND SKILLS OF A LEADER
Research shows that the qualities and skills of a leader include but are not limited to:
▶	 Being a visionary (e.g., help to describe the products, goals, and objectives of the project; 
able to dream and translate those dreams for others);
▶	 Being optimistic and positive;
▶	 Being collaborative;
▶	 Managing relationships and conflict by:
▹	
Building trust;

▹	
Developing and nurturing personal and professional networks;
▹	
Taking a long-term view that relationships are just as important as the project; and
▹	
Continuously developing and applying political acumen.
▶	 Communicating by:
▹	
Spending sufficient time communicating (research shows that top project managers 
spend about 90% of their time on a project in communicating);
▹	
Managing expectations;
▹	
Accepting feedback graciously;
▹	
Giving feedback constructively; and
▹	
Asking and listening.
▶	 Being respectful (helping others retain their autonomy), courteous, friendly, kind, honest, 
trustworthy, loyal, and ethical;

▹	
Differentiating high-level strategic priorities, especially those related to critical success 
factors for the project;
▹	
Maintaining vigilance on primary project constraints;
▹	
Remaining flexible on tactical priorities; and
▹	
Being able to sift through massive amounts of information to obtain the most 
important information.
▶	 Having a holistic and systemic view of the project, taking internal and external factors into 
account equally;
▶	 Being able to apply critical thinking (e.g., application of analytical methods to reach 
decisions) and identify themself as a change agent; and
▶	 Being able to build effective teams, be service oriented, and have fun and share humor 
effectively with team members.
3.3.1  LEADERSHIP STYLES
Project managers may lead their teams in many ways. The style a project manager selects may 
be a personal preference, or the result of the combination of multiple factors associated with the 
project. The style a project manager uses may change over time based on the factors in play. Major 
factors to consider include but are not limited to:
PMI Member benefit licensed to: Karsten Zenk - 5425687. Not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.


--- SOURCE: processgroupspracticeguide_eng.pdf | PAGE 83 ---
62
Process Groups: A Practice Guide
▶	 Leader characteristics (e.g., attitudes, moods, needs, values, ethics);
▶	 Team member characteristics (e.g., attitudes, moods, needs, values, ethics);
▶	 Organizational characteristics (e.g., its purpose, structure, and type of work performed); and
▶	 Environmental characteristics (e.g., social situation, economic state, and political elements).
Research describes numerous leadership styles that a project manager can adopt. Some of the 
most common examples of these styles include but are not limited to:
▶	 Laissez-faire (e.g., allowing the team to make their own decisions and establish their own 
goals, also referred to as taking a hands-off style);
▶	 Transactional (e.g., focus on goals, feedback, and accomplishment to determine rewards; 
management by exception);
▶	 Servant leader (e.g., demonstrates commitment to serve and put other people first; focuses 
on other people’s growth, learning, development, autonomy, and well-being; concentrates 
on relationships, community, and collaboration; leadership is secondary and emerges  
after service);
▶	 Transformational (e.g., empowering followers through idealized attributes and behaviors, 
inspirational motivation, encouragement for innovation and creativity, and individual 
consideration);
▶	 Charismatic (e.g., able to inspire; is high-energy, enthusiastic, self-confident; holds strong 
convictions); and
▶	 Interactional (e.g., a combination of transactional, transformational, and charismatic).
3.3.2  LEADERSHIP COMPARED TO MANAGEMENT
The words leadership and management are often used interchangeably. However, they are not 
synonymous. The word management is more closely associated with directing another person to get 
from one point to another using a known set of expected behaviors. In contrast, leadership involves 
working with others through discussion or debate in order to guide them from one point to another.

Role of the Project Manager
The method that a project manager chooses to employ reveals a distinct difference in 
behavior, self-perception, and project role. Table 3-1 compares management and leadership on 
several important levels.
Project managers need to employ both leadership and management in order to be successful. 
The skill is in finding the right balance for each situation. The way in which management and leadership 
are employed often shows up in the project manager’s leadership style.
3.3.3  POLITICS, POWER, AND GETTING THINGS DONE
Leadership and management are ultimately about being able to get things done. The skills and 
qualities noted help the project manager to achieve project goals and objectives. At the root of many 
of these skills and qualities is the ability to deal with politics. Politics involves influence, negotiation, 
autonomy, and power.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
The project manager observes and collects data about the project and organizational 
landscapes. The data then needs to be reviewed in the context of the project, the people involved, 
the organization, and the environment as a whole. This review yields the information and knowledge 
necessary for the project manager to plan and implement the most appropriate action. The project 
manager’s action is a result of selecting the right kind of power to influence and negotiate with 
others. Exercise of power also carries with it the responsibility of being sensitive to and respectful of 
other people. The effective action of the project manager maintains the autonomy of those involved. 
The project manager’s action results in the right people performing the activities necessary to fulfill 
the project’s objectives.
Power can originate with traits exhibited by the individual or the organization. Power is often 
supported by other people’s perceptions of the leader. It is essential for project managers to be 
aware of their relationships with other people. Relationships enable project managers to get things 
done on the project. There are numerous forms of power at the disposal of project managers. Power 
and its use can be complex given its nature and the various factors at play in a project. Various forms 
of power include but are not limited to:
▶	 Positional (sometimes called formal, authoritative, legitimate) (e.g., formal position 
granted in the organization or team);
▶	 Informational (e.g., control of gathering or distribution);
▶	 Referent (e.g., respect or admiration others hold for the individual, credibility gained);
▶	 Situational (e.g., gained due to unique situation such as a specific crisis);
▶	 Personal or charismatic (e.g., charm, attraction);
▶	 Relational (e.g., participates in networking, connections, and alliances);
▶	 Expert (e.g., skill, information possessed; experience, training, education, certification);
▶	 Reward-oriented (e.g., ability to give praise, monetary rewards, or other desired items);
▶	 Punitive or coercive (e.g., ability to invoke discipline or negative consequences);
▶	 Ingratiating (e.g., application of flattery or other common ground to win favor or cooperation);
▶	 Pressure-based (e.g., limit freedom of choice or movement for the purpose of gaining 
compliance to desired action);
PMI Member benefit licensed to: Karsten Zenk - 5425687. Not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.


--- SOURCE: processgroupspracticeguide_eng.pdf | PAGE 86 ---
65
Role of the Project Manager
▶	 Guilt-based (e.g., imposition of obligation or sense of duty);
▶	 Persuasive (e.g., ability to provide arguments that move people to a desired course  
of action); and
▶	 Avoiding (e.g., refusing to participate).
Top project managers are proactive and intentional when it comes to power. These project 
managers will work to acquire the power and authority they need within the boundaries of 
organizational policies, protocols, and procedures rather than wait for it to be granted.
3.3.4  PERSONALITY
Personality refers to the individual differences in characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, 
and behaving. Personality characteristics or traits include but are not limited to:
▶	 Authentic (e.g., accepts others for what and who they are, shows open concern);
▶	 Courteous (e.g., ability to apply appropriate behavior and etiquette);
▶	 Creative (e.g., ability to think abstractly, to see things differently, to innovate);
▶	 Cultural (e.g., measure of sensitivity to other cultures including values, norms, and beliefs);
▶	 Emotional (e.g., ability to perceive emotions and the information they present and to 
manage them; measure of interpersonal skills);
▶	 Intellectual (e.g., measure of human intelligence over multiple aptitudes);
▶	 Managerial (e.g., measure of management practice and potential);
▶	 Political (e.g., measure of political intelligence and making things happen);
▶	 Service-oriented (e.g., evidence of willingness to serve other people);
▶	 Social (e.g., ability to understand and manage people); and
▶	 Systemic (e.g., drive to understand and build systems).
An effective project manager will have some level of ability with each of these characteristics 
in order to be successful. Each project, organization, and situation requires the project manager to 
emphasize different aspects of personality.

3.4  PERFORMING INTEGRATION
The role of the project manager is twofold when performing integration on the project:
▶	 Project managers play a key role in working with the project sponsor to understand the 
strategic objectives and ensure the alignment of the project objectives and results with those 
of the portfolio, program, and business areas. In this way, project managers contribute to 
the integration and execution of the strategy.
▶	 Project managers are responsible for guiding the team to work together to focus on what 
is really essential at the project level. This is achieved through the integration of processes, 
knowledge, and people.
Integration is a critical skill for project managers and takes place at three different levels: the 
process, cognitive, and context levels.
3.4.1  PERFORMING INTEGRATION AT THE PROCESS LEVEL
Project management may be seen as a set of processes and activities that are undertaken to 
achieve the project objectives. Some of these processes may take place once (e.g., the initial creation 
of the project charter), but many others overlap and occur several times throughout the project. One 
example of this process overlap and multiple occurrences is a change in a requirement that impacts 
scope, schedule, or budget and requires a change request. Several project management processes 
such as the Control Scope process and the Perform Integrated Change Control process may involve 
a change request. The Perform Integrated Change Control process occurs throughout the project for 
integrating change requests.
Although there is no stated definition on how to integrate the project processes, it is clear that 
a project has a small chance of meeting its objective if the project manager fails to integrate the 
project processes where they interact.

67
Role of the Project Manager
3.4.2  INTEGRATION AT THE COGNITIVE LEVEL
There are many different ways to manage a project. The method selected typically depends 
on the specific characteristics of the project including its size, how complicated the project or 
organization may be, and the culture of the performing organization. It is clear that the personal skills 
and abilities of the project manager are closely related to the way in which the project is managed.
The project manager applies experience, insight, ways of working, power skills, and business 
acumen to the project. It is through the project manager’s ability to integrate the applicable project 
management processes, which makes it possible to achieve the desired project results.
3.4.3  INTEGRATION AT THE CONTEXT LEVEL
There have been many changes in the context in which business and projects take place 
today compared to a few decades ago. New technologies have been introduced. Social networks, 
multicultural aspects, virtual teams, and new values are part of the new reality of projects. One 
example is knowledge and people integration in the context of a large, cross-functional project 
implementation involving multiple organizations. The project manager considers the implications  
of this context in communications planning and knowledge management to guide the project team.
Project managers need to be cognizant of the project context and these new aspects when 
managing the integration. Then project managers can decide how to best use these new elements 
of the environment in their projects to achieve success.
3.4.4  INTEGRATION AND COMPLEXITY
Some projects may be referred to as complex and considered difficult to manage. In simple 
terms, complex and complicated are concepts often used to describe what is considered to be intricate.

--- SOURCE: processgroupspracticeguide_eng.pdf | PAGE 89 ---
68
Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Complexity itself is a perception of an individual based on personal experience, observation, 
and skill. Rather than being complex, a project is more accurately described as containing complexity. 
Portfolios, programs, and projects may contain elements of complexity.
When approaching the integration of a project, the project manager should consider 
elements that are both inside and outside of the project. The project manager should examine the 
characteristics or properties of the project. Complexity as a characteristic or property of a project 
is typically defined as:
▶	 Containing multiple parts,
▶	 Possessing a number of connections between the parts,
▶	 Exhibiting dynamic interactions between the parts, and
▶	 Exhibiting behavior, produced as a result of those interactions, which cannot be explained 
as the simple sum of the parts (e.g., emergent behavior).
Examining these various items that appear to make the project complex should help the 
project manager identify key areas when planning, managing, and controlling the project to 
ensure integration.
Three Dimensions of Complexity
Complexity within projects is a result of the organization’s system behavior, human behavior,  
and the uncertainty at work in the organization or its environment. In Navigating Complexity:  
A Practice Guide [7], these three dimensions of complexity are defined as:
▶	 System behavior. The interdependencies of components and systems.
▶	 Human behavior. The interplay between diverse individuals and groups.
▶	 Ambiguity. Uncertainty of emerging issues and lack of understanding or confusion.

Initiating Process Group
The processes in the Initiating Process Group are shown in Table 4-1.
These processes define a new project or a new phase of an existing project by obtaining 
authorization to start the project or phase. The purpose of this Process Group is to align stakeholder 
expectations and the project purpose, inform stakeholders of the scope and objectives, and discuss 
how their participation in the project and its associated phases can help to ensure their expectations 
are met. The initial scope is defined and initial financial resources are committed. Stakeholders who 
will interact and influence the overall outcome of the project are identified. The project manager is 
appointed if not already assigned. This information is captured in the project charter and stakeholder 
register. When the project charter is approved, the project is officially authorized, and the project 
manager is authorized to apply organizational resources to the project activities.
The key benefits of this Process Group are that only projects that are aligned with the 
organization’s strategic objectives are authorized and the business case, benefits, and stakeholders 
are considered from the start of the project. In some organizations, the project manager is involved in 
developing the business case and defining the benefits. In those organizations, the project manager 
generally helps write the project charter; in other organizations, the pre-project work is done by the 
project sponsor, project management office (PMO), portfolio steering committee, or other stakeholder 
group. This practice guide assumes the project has been approved by the sponsor or other governing 
body and the business documents have been reviewed prior to authorizing the project. In most cases, 
business documents originate outside of the project, but are used as inputs to the project.

Business documents are documents that are generally originated outside of the project but 
are used as inputs to the project. Examples of business documents include the business case and 
benefits management plan. Figure 4-1 shows the sponsor and the business documents in relation 
to the Initiating Processes.
Projects are often divided into phases. When this is done, information from processes in the 
Initiating Process Group is reexamined to determine if the information is still valid. Revisiting the 
Initiating processes at the start of each phase helps keep the project focused on the business need 
that the project was undertaken to address. The project charter, business documents, and success 
criteria are verified. The influence drivers, expectations, and objectives of the project stakeholders 
are reviewed.

4.1  DEVELOP PROJECT CHARTER
Develop Project Charter is the process for developing the document that formally authorizes 
the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational 
resources to project activities. The key benefits of this process are:
▶	 Provides a direct link between the project and the strategic objectives of the organization,
▶	 Creates a formal record of the project, and
▶	 Shows the organizational commitment to the project.
This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, 
and outputs are shown in Figure 4-2. Figure 4-3 presents the data flow diagram for this process.
Involve Stakeholders
Involving the sponsors, customers, and other stakeholders during initiation creates a shared 
understanding of success criteria. It also increases the likelihood of deliverable acceptance when 
the project is complete and stakeholder satisfaction throughout the project.

Initiating Process Group
The project charter establishes a partnership between the performing and requesting 
organizations. In the case of external projects, a formal contract is typically the preferred way 
to establish an agreement. A project charter may still be used to establish internal agreements 
within an organization to ensure proper delivery under the contract. The approved project charter 
formally initiates the project. A project manager is identified and assigned as early in the project 
as is feasible, preferably while the project charter is being developed and always prior to the 
start of planning. The project charter can be developed by the sponsor or the project manager 
in collaboration with the initiating entity. This collaboration allows the project manager to have a 
better understanding of the project purpose, objectives, and expected benefits. This understanding 
will better allow for efficient resource allocation to project activities. The project charter provides 
the project manager with the authority to plan, execute, and control the project.
Projects are initiated by an entity external to the project such as a sponsor, program, or project 
management office (PMO), or a portfolio governing body chairperson or authorized representative. 
The project initiator or sponsor should be at a level that is appropriate to procure funding and 
commit resources to the project. Projects are initiated due to internal business needs or external 
influences. These needs or influences often trigger the creation of a needs analysis, feasibility study, 
business case, or description of the situation that the project will address. Chartering a project 
validates alignment of the project to the strategy and ongoing work of the organization. A project 
charter is not considered to be a contract because there is no consideration or money promised  
or exchanged in its creation.
4.2  IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS
Identify Stakeholders is the process of identifying project stakeholders regularly and analyzing 
and documenting relevant information regarding their interests, involvement, interdependencies, 
influence, and potential impact on project success. The key benefit of this process is that it enables 
the project team to identify the appropriate focus for engagement of each stakeholder or group of 
stakeholders.
This process is performed periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs are shown in Figure 4-4. Figure 4-5 presents the data flow diagram for 
this process.

This process frequently occurs for the first time in a project either prior to or at the same time 
the project charter is developed and approved. It is repeated as necessary but should be performed 
at the start of each phase and when a significant change in the project or the organization occurs. 
Each time the identification process is repeated, the project management plan components and 
project documents should be consulted to identify relevant project stakeholders.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
The Planning Process Group consists of those processes that establish the total scope of the 
effort, define and refine the objectives, and develop the course of action required to attain those 
objectives. The processes in the Planning Process Group develop the components of the project 
management plan and the project documents used to carry out the project. The nature of a project 
may require the use of repeated feedback loops for additional analysis. As more project information 
or characteristics are gathered and understood, additional planning will likely be required. Significant 
changes that occur throughout the project life cycle may initiate a need to revisit one or more of the 
planning processes and, possibly, one or both of the Initiating processes. This ongoing refinement 
of the project management plan is called progressive elaboration, indicating that planning and 
documentation are iterative or ongoing activities. The key benefit of this Process Group is to define 
the course of action to successfully complete the project or phase.
The project management team seeks input and encourages involvement from relevant 
stakeholders while planning the project and developing the project management plan and project 
documents. When the initial planning effort is completed, the approved version of the project 
management plan is considered a baseline. Throughout the project, the Monitoring and Controlling 
processes compare the project performance to the baselines.
The Planning Process Group project management processes are described in Sections 5.1 
through 5.24.
5.1  DEVELOP PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
Develop Project Management Plan is the process of defining, preparing, and coordinating all 
plan components and consolidating them into an integrated project management plan. The key 
benefit of this process is the production of a comprehensive document that defines the basis of all 
project work and how the work will be performed.
This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs are shown in Figure 5-1. Figure 5-2 presents the data flow diagram for  
this process.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
The project management plan defines how the project is 
executed, monitored and controlled, and closed. The project 
management plan’s content varies depending on the application 
area and complexity of the project.
The project management plan may be either summary 
level or detailed. Each component plan is described to the 
extent required by the specific project. The project management 
plan should be robust enough to respond to an ever-changing 
project environment. This agility may result in more accurate 
information as the project progresses.
The project management plan should be baselined; 
that is, it is necessary to define at least the project 
references for scope, time, and cost, so that the project 
execution can be measured and compared to those 
references and performance can be managed. Before the 
baselines are defined, the project management plan may be 
updated as many times as necessary. No formal process is 
required at that time. But, once it is baselined, it may only 
be changed through the Perform Integrated Change Control 
process. Consequently, change requests will be generated 
and decided upon whenever a change is requested. This 
results in a project management plan that is progressively 
elaborated by controlled and approved updates extending 
through project closure.
Projects that exist in the 
context of a program or 
portfolio should develop 
a project management plan that 
is consistent with the program 
or portfolio management plan. 
For example, if the program 
management plan indicates all 
changes exceeding a specified 
cost need to be reviewed by the 
change control board (CCB), then 
this process and cost threshold 
need to be defined in the project 
management plan.

5.2  PLAN SCOPE MANAGEMENT
Plan Scope Management is the process of creating a scope management plan that documents 
how the project and product scope will be defined, validated, and controlled. The key benefit  
of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how scope will be managed throughout  
the project.
This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs are shown in in Figure 5-3. Figure 5-4 presents the data flow diagram for  
this process.

The scope management plan is a component of the project or program management plan 
that describes how the scope will be defined, developed, monitored, controlled, and validated. The 
development of the scope management plan and the detailing of the project scope begin with the 
analysis of information contained in the project charter, the latest approved subsidiary plans of the 
project management plan, historical information contained in the organizational process assets,  
and any other relevant enterprise environmental factors.

5.3  COLLECT REQUIREMENTS
Collect Requirements is the process of determining, documenting, and managing stakeholder 
needs and requirements to meet objectives. The key benefit of this process is that it provides the 
basis for defining the product scope and project scope.
This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs are shown in Figure 5-5. Figure 5-6 presents the data flow diagram for

This practice guide does not specifically address product requirements since those are industry 
specific. Note that Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide [3] provides more in-depth 
information about product requirements. A project’s success is directly influenced by active stakeholder 
involvement in the discovery and decomposition of needs into project and product requirements 
and by the care taken in determining, documenting, and managing the requirements of the product, 
service, or result of the project. Requirements include conditions or capabilities that are required 
to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed 
specification. Requirements include the quantified and documented needs and expectations of the 
sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders. These requirements need to be elicited, analyzed, and 
recorded in enough detail to be included in the scope baseline and to be measured once project 
execution begins. Requirements become the foundation of the work breakdown structure (WBS). 
Cost, schedule, quality planning, and procurement are all based on these requirements.
5.4  DEFINE SCOPE
Define Scope is the process of developing a detailed description of the project and product. 
The key benefit of this process is that it describes the product, service, or result boundaries and 
acceptance criteria.
This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs are shown in Figure 5-7. Figure 5-8 presents the data flow diagram for  
this process.

Since all of the requirements identified in Collect Requirements may not be included in the 
project, the Define Scope process results in the selection of the final project requirements from the 
requirements documentation developed during the Collect Requirements process. It then develops

Planning Process Group
The preparation of a detailed project scope statement builds upon the high-level project 
description that is documented during project initiation. During project planning, the project scope 
is defined and described with greater specificity as more information about the project is known. 
Existing risks, assumptions, and constraints are analyzed for completeness and added or updated 
as necessary. The Define Scope process can be highly iterative. In iterative life cycle projects, a 
high-level vision will be developed for the overall project, but the detailed scope is determined one 
iteration at a time, and the detailed planning for the next iteration is carried out as work progresses 
on the current project scope and deliverables.
5.5  CREATE WBS
Create WBS is the process of subdividing project deliverables and project work into smaller, 
more manageable components. The key benefit of this process is that it provides a framework  
of what has to be delivered.
This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs are shown in Figure 5-9. Figure 5-10 presents the data flow diagram for  
this process.

The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the 
project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. The WBS 
organizes and defines the total scope of the project and represents the work specified in the current 
approved project scope statement.
The planned work is contained within the lowest level of WBS components, which are called work 
packages. A work package can be used to group the activities where work is scheduled and estimated, 
monitored, and controlled. In the context of the WBS, work refers to work products or deliverables that 
are the result of activity and not to the activity itself.

5.6  PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT
Plan Schedule Management is the process of establishing the policies, procedures, and 
documentation for planning, developing, managing, executing, and controlling the project schedule. 
The key benefit of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how the project schedule 
will be managed throughout the project.
This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and

Every activity except the first and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at 
least one successor activity with an appropriate logical relationship. Logical relationships should be 
designed to create a realistic project schedule. It may be necessary to use lead or lag time between 
activities to support a realistic and achievable project schedule (see leads and lags in Section 10). 
Sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or 
automated techniques. The Sequence Activities process concentrates on converting the project 
activities from a list to a diagram to act as a first step to publish the schedule baseline.

Estimating activity durations uses information from the scope of work, required resource 
types or skill levels, estimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. Other factors that may 
influence the duration estimates include constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or 
type of resources (e.g., fixed duration, fixed effort or work, fixed number of resources), as well as the 
schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of duration originate from the 
person or gro	 up on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the specific 
activity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and 
availability of the input data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the 
project engineering and design work, the accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
The Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort 
required to complete the activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the 
activity. These estimates are used to approximate the number of work periods (activity duration) 
needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project and resource calendars. In many cases, 
the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an activity, along with the 
skill proficiency of those resources, may determine the activity’s duration. A change to a driving 
resource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple 
“straight-line” or linear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints 
imposed on the duration, effort involved, or number of resources) will take a predetermined amount 
of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation (e.g., a 24-hour stress test). Other factors 
for consideration when estimating duration include:
▶	 Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort 
required to produce a unit of work is increased while all other factors remain fixed, a point 
will eventually be reached at which additions of that one factor start to yield progressively 
smaller or diminishing increases in output.
▶	 Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number 
of the resources does not always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration 
due to risk, and at some point adding too many resources to the activity may increase 
duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additional coordination, and other 
factors involved.
▶	 Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration 
estimates. For example, an increase in the output of a manufacturing plant may be 
achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology, which may impact duration and 
resource needs.
▶	 Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome—
or procrastination—when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible 
moment before the deadline, and Parkinson’s Law where work expands to fill the time 
available for its completion.
All data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity 
duration estimate.

5.10  DEVELOP SCHEDULE
Develop Schedule is the process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource 
requirements, and schedule constraints to create a schedule model for project execution and 
monitoring and controlling. The key benefit of this process is that it generates a schedule model 
with planned dates for completing project activities.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs

Planning Process Group
Developing an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process. The schedule model is used 
to determine the planned start and finish dates for project activities and milestones based on the 
best available information. Schedule development can require the review and revision of duration 
estimates, resource estimates, and schedule reserves to establish an approved project schedule that 
can serve as a baseline to track progress. Key steps include defining the project milestones, identifying 
and sequencing activities, and estimating durations. Once the activity start and finish dates have been 
determined, it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assigned 
activities. The staff confirms that the start and finish dates present no conflict with resource calendars 
or assigned activities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. The schedule is then analyzed 
to determine conflicts with logical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule 
is approved and baselined. Revising and maintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic 
schedule continues throughout the duration of the project.
For more specific information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling [8].
5.11  PLAN COST MANAGEMENT
Plan Cost Management is the process of defining how the project costs will be estimated, 
budgeted, managed, monitored, and controlled. The key benefit of this process is that it provides 
guidance and direction on how the project costs will be managed throughout the project.
This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs are shown in Figure 5-21. Figure 5-22 presents the data flow diagram for

The cost management planning effort occurs early in project planning and sets the framework 
for each of the cost management processes so that performance of the processes will be efficient 
and coordinated. The cost management processes and their associated tools and techniques are 
documented in the cost management plan. The cost management plan is a component of the project 
management plan.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
A cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely 
costs for resources required to complete the activity. It is a 
prediction that is based on the information known at a given 
point in time. Cost estimates include the identification and 
consideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete 
the project. Cost trade-offs and risks should be considered, 
such as make versus buy, buy versus lease, and the sharing  
of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project.
Cost estimates should be reviewed and refined during 
the course of the project to reflect additional detail as it 
becomes available and assumptions are tested. The accuracy 
of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses 
through the project life cycle. For example, a project in the 
start-up phase may have a rough order of magnitude (ROM) 
estimate in the range of −25% to +75%. Later in the project, as 
more information is known, definitive estimates could narrow 
the range of accuracy to −5% to +10%. In some organizations, 
there are guidelines for when such refinements can be made 
and the degree of confidence or accuracy that is expected.
Costs are estimated for all resources that will be charged 
to the project. This includes but is not limited to labor, materials, 
equipment, services, and facilities, as well as special categories 
such as an inflation allowance, cost of financing, or contingency 
costs. Cost estimates may be presented at the activity level or  
in summary form.
Cost estimates are 
generally expressed in 
units of some currency 
(i.e., dollars, euros, yen, etc.), 
although in some instances 
other units of measure, such 
as staff hours or staff days, are 
used to facilitate comparisons 
by eliminating the effects of 
currency fluctuations.

5.13  DETERMINE BUDGET
Determine Budget is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities 
or work packages to establish an authorized cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that it 
determines the cost baseline against which project performance can be monitored and controlled.
This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs are shown in Figure 5-25. Figure 5-26 presents the data flow diagram for  
this process.
A project budget includes all of the funds authorized to execute the project. The cost baseline 
is the approved version of the time-phased project budget that includes contingency reserves but 
excludes management reserves.

Resource planning is used to determine and identify an 
approach to ensure that sufficient resources are available for 
the successful completion of the project. Project resources 
may include team members, supplies, materials, equipment, 
services, and facilities. Effective resource planning should 
consider and plan for the availability of, or competition for, 
scarce resources.
5.16  ESTIMATE ACTIVITY RESOURCES
Estimate Activity Resources is the process of estimating 
team resources and the type and quantities of materials, 
equipment, and supplies necessary to perform project work. 
The key benefit of this process is that it identifies the type, 
quantity, and characteristics of resources required to complete 
the project.
This process is performed periodically throughout the project 
as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs 
are shown in Figure 5-31. Figure 5-32 presents the data flow 
diagram for this process.
Project resources  
can be obtained from 
the organization’s 
internal assets or from outside 
the organization through a 
procurement process. Other 
projects may be competing for 
the same resources required for 
the project at the same time and 
location. This may significantly 
impact project costs, schedules, 
risks, quality, and other  
project areas.

The Estimate Activity Resources process is closely coordinated with other processes, such as 
the Estimate Costs process. For example:
▶	 A construction project team will need to be familiar with local building codes. Such knowledge 
is often readily available from local sellers. If the internal labor pool lacks experience with 
unusual or specialized construction techniques, the additional cost for a consultant may be 
the most effective way to secure knowledge of the local building codes.
▶	 An automotive design team will need to be familiar with the latest automated assembly 
techniques. The requisite knowledge could be obtained by hiring a consultant, by sending 
a designer to a seminar on robotics, or by including someone from manufacturing as a 
member of the project team.

An effective communications management plan that recognizes the diverse information 
needs of the project’s stakeholders is developed early in the project life cycle. It should be reviewed 
regularly and modified when necessary, when the stakeholder community changes or at the start 
of each new project phase.
On most projects, communications planning is performed very early, during stakeholder 
identification and project management plan development.

While all projects share the need to communicate project information, the information needs 
and methods of distribution may vary widely. In addition, the methods of storage, retrieval, and 
ultimate disposition of the project information need to be considered and documented during this 
process. The results of the Plan Communications Management process should be reviewed regularly 
throughout the project and revised as needed to ensure continued applicability
5.18  PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT
Plan Risk Management is the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities 
for a project. The key benefit of this process is that it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility 
of risk management are proportionate to both risks and the importance of the project to the 
organization and other stakeholders.
This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs are shown in Figure 5-35. Figure 5-36 presents the data flow diagram for  
this process.

The Plan Risk Management process should begin when a project is conceived and should be 
completed early in the project. It may be necessary to revisit this process later in the project life cycle, 
for example at a major phase change, if the project scope changes significantly, or if a subsequent 
review of risk management effectiveness determines that the Plan Risk Management process 
requires modification.

5.19  IDENTIFY RISKS
Identify Risks is the process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall 
project risk and documenting their characteristics. The key benefit of this process is the documentation 
of existing individual project risks and the sources of overall project risk. It also brings together 
information so the project team can respond appropriately to identified risks.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs 
are shown in Figure 5-37. Figure 5-38 presents the data flow diagram for this process.

Planning Process Group
Identify Risks considers both individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. 
Participants in risk identification activities may include the following: project manager, project team 
members, business analyst, project risk specialist (if assigned), customers, subject matter experts from 
outside the project team, end users, other project managers, operations managers, stakeholders, and 
risk management experts within the organization. While these personnel are often key participants  
for risk identification, all project stakeholders should be encouraged to identify individual project risks. 
It is particularly important to involve the project team so they can develop and maintain a sense  
of ownership and responsibility for identified individual project risks, the level of overall project risk, 
and associated risk response actions.
When describing and recording individual project risks, a consistent format should be used for 
risk statements to ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order to support 
effective analysis and risk response development. Risk owners for individual project risks may be 
nominated as part of the Identify Risks process and will be confirmed during the Perform Qualitative 
Risk Analysis process. Preliminary risk responses may also be identified and recorded and will be 
reviewed and confirmed as part of the Plan Risk Responses process.
5.20  PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is the process of prioritizing individual project risks for 
further analysis or action by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact as well as other 
characteristics. The key benefit of this process is that it focuses efforts on high-priority risks.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs 
are shown in Figure 5-39. Figure 5-40 presents the data flow diagram for this process.
Identify Risks is an iterative process, since new individual project risks may emerge as the 
project progresses through its life cycle and the level of overall project risk will also change.  
The frequency of iteration and participation in each risk identification cycle will vary by situation, 
and this will be defined in the risk management plan.

Planning Process Group
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis assesses the priority 
of identified individual project risks using their probability of 
occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives 
if the risks occur, and other factors. Such assessments are 
subjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the 
project team and other stakeholders. Effective assessment 
therefore requires explicit identification and management of 
the risk attitudes of key participants in the Perform Qualitative 
Risk Analysis process. Risk perception introduces bias into the 
assessment of identified risks, so attention should be paid 
to identifying bias and correcting for it. Where a facilitator 
is used to support the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis 
process, addressing bias is a key part of the facilitator’s role. 
An evaluation of the quality of the available information on 
individual project risks also helps to clarify the assessment  
of each risk’s importance to the project.
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis establishes the relative 
priorities of individual project risks for Plan Risk Responses. It 
identifies a risk owner for each risk who will take responsibility 
for planning an appropriate risk response and ensuring that 
it is implemented. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis also lays 
the foundation for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis if this 
process is required.
The Perform Qualitative 
Risk Analysis process 
is performed regularly 
throughout the project life cycle, 
as defined in the risk management 
plan. Often, in an agile 
development environment, the 
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis 
process is conducted before the 
start of each iteration.

5.21  PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the combined effect 
of identified individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty on overall project objectives. 
The key benefit of this process is that it quantifies overall project risk exposure, and it can also 
provide additional quantitative risk information to support risk response planning.
This process is not required for every project, but where it is used, it is performed throughout 
the project. The inputs and outputs are shown in Figure 5-41. Figure 5-42 presents the data flow 
diagram for this process.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis is not required for all projects. Undertaking a robust 
analysis depends on the availability of high-quality data about individual project risks and other 
sources of uncertainty, as well as a sound underlying project baseline for scope, schedule, and cost. 
Quantitative risk analysis usually requires specialized risk software and expertise in the development 
and interpretation of risk models. It also consumes additional time and cost. The use of quantitative 
risk analysis for a project will be specified in the project’s risk management plan. It is most likely 
appropriate for large or complex projects, strategically important projects, projects for which it is a 
contractual requirement, or projects in which a key stakeholder requires it. Quantitative risk analysis 
is the only reliable method to assess overall project risk through evaluating the aggregated effect on 
project outcomes of all individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty.
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis uses information on individual project risks that have been 
assessed by the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process as having a significant potential to affect 
the project’s objectives.
Outputs from Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis are used as inputs to the Plan Risk Responses 
process, particularly in recommending responses to the level of overall project risk and key individual 
risks. A quantitative risk analysis may also be undertaken following the Plan Risk Responses process 
to determine the likely effectiveness of planned responses in reducing overall project risk exposure.
5.22  PLAN RISK RESPONSES
Plan Risk Responses is the process of developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing 
on actions to address overall project risk exposure as well as to treat individual project risks. The 
key benefit of this process is that it identifies appropriate ways to address overall project risk and 
individual project risks. This process also allocates resources and inserts activities into project 
documents and the project management plan as needed.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs 
are shown in Figure 5-43. Figure 5-44 presents the data flow diagram for this process.

Effective and appropriate risk responses can minimize individual threats, maximize individual 
opportunities, and reduce overall project risk exposure. Unsuitable risk responses can have 
the converse effect. Once risks have been identified, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be 
developed by the nominated risk owner for addressing every individual project risk the project team 
considers to be sufficiently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project objectives 
or the opportunity it offers. The project manager should also consider how to respond appropriately 
to the current level of overall project risk.

Risk responses should be appropriate for the significance of the risk, cost effective in meeting 
the challenge, realistic within the project context, agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned  
by a responsible person. Selecting the optimal risk response from several options is often required. 
The strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective should be selected for each risk. Structured 
decision-making techniques may be used to choose the most appropriate response. For large or 
complex projects, it may be appropriate to use a mathematical optimization model or real options 
analysis as a basis for a more robust economic analysis of alternative risk response strategies.
Specific actions are developed to implement the agreed-upon risk response strategy, including 
primary and backup strategies, as necessary. A contingency plan (or fallback plan) can be developed 
for implementation if the selected strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk 
occurs. Secondary risks should also be identified. Secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct  
result of implementing a risk response. A contingency reserve is often allocated for time or cost.  
If developed, it may include identification of the conditions that trigger its use.
5.23  PLAN PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
Plan Procurement Management is the process of documenting project procurement decisions, 
specifying the approach, and identifying potential sellers. The key benefit of this process is that it 
determines whether to acquire goods and services from outside the project and, if so, what to acquire 
as well as how and when to acquire it. Goods and services may be procured from other parts of the 
performing organization or from external sources.
This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs are shown in Figure 5-45. Figure 5-46 presents the data flow diagram  
for this process.

Defining roles and responsibilities related to procurement 
should be done early in the Plan Procurement Management 
process. The project manager should ensure that the project 
team is staffed with procurement expertise at the level required 
for the project. Participants in the procurement process 
may include personnel from the purchasing or procurement 
department as well as personnel from the buying organization’s 
legal department. These responsibilities should be documented 
in the procurement management plan.
The requirements of the project schedule can significantly 
influence the strategy during the Plan Procurement Management 
process. Decisions made in developing the procurement 
management plan can also influence the project schedule and 
are integrated with the Develop Schedule process, the Estimate 
Activity Resources process, and make-or-buy decisions.
Typical Steps in the 
Plan Procurement 
Management Process
▶	 Prepare the procurement 
statement of work (SOW) or 
terms of reference (TOR).
▶	 Prepare a high-level cost 
estimate to determine  
the budget.
▶	 Advertise the opportunity.
▶	 Identify a short list of 
qualified sellers.
▶	 Prepare and issue bid 
documents.
▶	 Prepare and submit proposals 
by the seller.
▶	 Conduct a technical 
evaluation of the proposals 
including quality.
▶	 Perform a cost evaluation  
of the proposals.
▶	 Prepare the final combined 
quality and cost evaluation to 
select the winning proposal.
▶	 Finalize negotiations and sign 
contract between the buyer 
and the seller.

5.24  PLAN STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Plan Stakeholder Engagement is the process of developing approaches to involve project 
stakeholders based on their needs, expectations, interests, and potential impact on the project. 
The key benefit is that it provides an actionable plan to interact effectively with stakeholders.
This process is performed periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs are shown in Figure 5-47. Figure 5-48 presents the data flow diagram for  
this process.

Planning Process Group
An effective plan that recognizes the diverse 
information needs of the project’s stakeholders is developed 
early in the project life cycle and is reviewed and updated 
regularly as the stakeholder community changes. The first 
version of the stakeholder engagement plan is developed 
after the initial stakeholder community has been identified 
by the Identify Stakeholder process. The stakeholder 
engagement plan is updated regularly to reflect changes  
to the stakeholder community.
Situations Requiring 
Updates to  
the Stakeholder 
Engagement Plan
Typical trigger situations requiring 
updates to the plan include, but 
are not limited to:
▶	 The start of a new phase  
of the project;
▶	 Changes to the organizational 
structure or changes within  
the industry;
▶	 New individuals or groups 
become stakeholders, current 
stakeholders are no longer part 
of the stakeholder community, 
or there are changes regarding 
the importance of particular 
stakeholders to the project’s 
success; and
▶	 Outputs of other project 
processes, such as change 
management, risk management, 
or issue management, require 
a review of stakeholder 
engagement strategies.

Executing Process Group
The processes in the Executing Process Group are shown in Table 6-1.
The Executing Process Group consists of those processes performed to complete the 
work defined in the project management plan to satisfy the project requirements. This Process 
Group involves coordinating resources, managing stakeholder engagement, and integrating and 
performing the activities of the project in accordance with the project management plan. The 
key benefit of this Process Group is that the work needed to meet the project requirements and 
objectives is performed according to plan. A large portion of the project budget, resources, and time 
is expended in performing the Executing Process Group processes. The processes in the Executing 
Process Group may generate change requests. If approved, the change requests may trigger one 
or more Planning processes that result in a modified management plan, project documents, and 
possibly new baselines. The Executing Process Group includes the project management processes 
identified in Sections 6.1 through 6.10.

Direct and Manage Project Work involves executing the planned project activities to complete 
project deliverables and accomplish established objectives. Available resources are allocated, their 
efficient use is managed, and changes in project plans stemming from analyzing work performance 
data and information are carried out. The Direct and Manage Project Work process is directly affected 
by the project application area. Deliverables are produced as outputs from processes performed to 
accomplish the project work as planned and scheduled in the project management plan.
The project manager, along with the project management team, directs the performance of 
the planned project activities and manages the various technical and organizational interfaces that 
exist in the project. Direct and Manage Project Work also requires review of the impact of all project 
changes and the implementation of approved changes: corrective action, preventive action, and/or 
defect repair.
During project execution, the work performance data are collected and communicated to the 
applicable controlling processes for analysis. Work performance data analysis provides information 
about the completion status of deliverables and other relevant details about project performance. 
The work performance data will also be used as an input to the Monitoring and Controlling Process 
Group. Work performance data can also be used as feedback into lessons learned to improve the 
performance of future work packages.

6.2  MANAGE PROJECT KNOWLEDGE
Manage Project Knowledge is the process of using existing knowledge and creating new 
knowledge to achieve the project’s objectives and contribute to organizational learning. The key 
benefits of this process are that prior organizational knowledge is leveraged to produce or improve 
the project outcomes, and knowledge created by the project is available to support organizational 
operations and future projects or phases.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs 
are shown in Figure 6-3. Figure 6-4 presents the data flow diagram for this process.

Knowledge is commonly split into “explicit” (knowledge that can be readily codified using 
words, pictures, and numbers) and “tacit” (knowledge that is personal and difficult to express, 
such as beliefs, insights, experience, and “know-how”). Knowledge management is concerned with 
managing both tacit and explicit knowledge for two purposes: reusing existing knowledge and 
creating new knowledge. The key activities that underpin both purposes are knowledge sharing and 
knowledge integration (of knowledge from different domains, contextual knowledge, and project 
management knowledge).
It is a common misconception that managing knowledge involves just documenting it so it 
can be shared. Another common misconception is that managing knowledge involves just obtaining 
lessons learned at the end of the project in order to use it in the future projects. Only codified 
explicit knowledge can be shared in this way. But codified explicit knowledge lacks context and is 
open to different interpretations, so even though it can easily be shared, it isn’t always understood or 
applied in the right way. Tacit knowledge has context built in but is very difficult to codify. It resides 
in the minds of individual experts or in social groups and situations, and is normally shared through 
conversations and interactions between people.
Create an Atmosphere of Trust
From an organizational perspective, knowledge management is about making sure the skills, 
experience, and expertise of the project team and other stakeholders are used before, during, and 
after the project. Because knowledge resides in the minds of people and people cannot be forced 
to share what they know (or to pay attention to others’ knowledge), the most important part of 
knowledge management is creating an atmosphere of trust so that people are motivated to share 
their knowledge. Even the best knowledge management tools and techniques will not work if 
people are not motivated to share what they know or to pay attention to what others know. In 
practice, knowledge is shared using a mixture of knowledge management tools and techniques 
(interactions between people) and information management tools and techniques (in which 
people codify part of their explicit knowledge by documenting it so it can be shared).

6.3  MANAGE QUALITY
Manage Quality is the process of translating the quality management plan into executable quality 
activities that incorporate the organization’s quality policies into the project. The key benefits of this 
process are that it increases the probability of meeting the quality objectives as well as identifying 
ineffective processes and causes of poor quality. Manage Quality uses the data and results from the 
Control Quality process to reflect the overall quality status of the project to the stakeholders.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs 
are shown in Figure 6-5. Figure 6-6 presents the data flow diagram for this process.

Manage Quality is sometimes called quality assurance, although Manage Quality has a 
broader definition than quality assurance as it is used in non-project work. In project management, 
the focus of quality assurance is on the processes used in the project. Quality assurance is 
about using project processes effectively. It involves following and meeting standards to assure 
stakeholders that the final product will meet their needs, expectations, and requirements. Manage 
Quality includes all the quality assurance activities and is also concerned with the product design 
aspects and process improvements. Manage Quality work will fall under the conformance work 
category in the cost of quality framework.

The Manage Quality process implements a set of planned 
and systematic acts and processes defined within the project’s 
quality management plan that helps to:
▶	 Design an optimal and mature product by implementing specific 
design guidelines that address specific aspects of the product,
▶	 Build confidence that a future output will be completed in a manner 
that meets the specified requirements and expectations through 
quality assurance tools and techniques such as quality audits and 
failure analysis,
▶	 Confirm that the quality processes are used and that their use 
meets the quality objectives of the project, and
▶	 Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and 
activities to achieve better results and performance and enhance 
stakeholders’ satisfaction.
The project manager and project team may use the organization’s quality assurance department, or 
other organizational functions, to execute some of the Manage Quality activities such as failure analysis, design 
of experiments, and quality improvement. Quality assurance departments usually have cross-organizational 
experience in using quality tools and techniques and are a good resource for the project.
Manage Quality is Considered the Work of Everybody
The project manager, the project team, the project sponsor, the management of the performing 
organization, and even the customer are all involved in this process. These roles have 
responsibilities for managing quality in the project, though the roles differ in size and effort. 
The level of participation in the quality management effort may differ between industries and 
project management styles.
In agile projects,  
quality management  
is performed by all  
team members throughout the 
project. In traditional projects, 
quality management is often  
the responsibility of specific  
team members.

The resources needed for a project can be internal or external to the project-performing 
organization. Internal resources are acquired (assigned) from functional or resource managers. 
External resources are acquired through the procurement processes.
The project management team may or may not have direct control over resource selection 
because of collective bargaining agreements, use of subcontractor personnel, a matrix project 
environment, internal or external reporting relationships, or other reasons. It is important that the 
following factors are considered during the process of acquiring the project resources:

▶	 The project manager or project team should effectively negotiate and influence others 
who are in a position to provide the required team and physical resources for the project.
▶	 Failure to acquire the necessary resources for the project may affect project schedules, 
budgets, customer satisfaction, quality, and risks. Insufficient resources or capabilities 
decrease the probability of success and, in a worst-case scenario, could result in project 
cancellation.
▶	 If the team resources are not available due to constraints such as economic factors or 
assignment to other projects, the project manager or project team may be required to 
assign alternative resources, perhaps with different competencies or costs. Alternative 
resources are allowed provided there is no violation of legal, regulatory, mandatory,  
or other specific criteria.
These factors should be considered and accounted for in the planning stages of the project. 
The project manager or project management team will be required to document the impact of the 
unavailability of required resources in the project schedule, project budget, project risks, project 
quality, training plans, and other project management plans.
6.5  DEVELOP TEAM
Develop Team is the process of improving competencies, team member interaction, and 
the overall team environment to enhance project performance. The key benefit of this process is 
that it results in improved teamwork, enhanced interpersonal skills and competencies, motivated 
employees, reduced attrition, and improved overall project performance.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs 
are shown in Figure 6-9. Figure 6-10 presents the data flow diagram for this process.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Project managers operate in a global environment and work on projects characterized by cultural 
diversity. Team members often have diverse industry experience, communicate in multiple languages, 
and sometimes work with a “team language” or cultural norm that may be different from their native 
one. The project management team should capitalize on cultural differences, focus on developing 
and sustaining the project team throughout the project life cycle, and promote working together 
interdependently in a climate of mutual trust. Developing the project team improves the people skills, 
technical competencies, and overall team environment and project performance. It requires clear, 
timely, effective, and efficient communication between team members throughout the life of the 
project. Objectives of developing a project team include but are not limited to:
▶	 Improve the knowledge and skills of team members to increase their ability to complete 
project deliverables, while lowering costs, reducing schedules, and improving quality.
▶	 Improve feelings of trust and agreement among team members to raise morale, lower 
conflict, and increase teamwork.
High-Performing Teams
Project managers should create an environment that facilitates teamwork and continually 
motivates the team by providing challenges and opportunities, providing timely feedback and 
support as needed, and recognizing and rewarding good performance. High team performance 
can be achieved by employing these behaviors:
▶	 Use open and effective communication.
▶	 Create team-building opportunities.
▶	 Develop trust among team members.
▶	 Manage conflicts in a constructive manner.
▶	 Encourage collaborative problem solving.
▶	 Encourage collaborative decision making.

▶	 Create a dynamic, cohesive, and collaborative team culture to: (1) improve individual and 
team productivity, team spirit, and cooperation; and (2) allow cross-training and mentoring 
between team members to share knowledge and expertise.
▶	 Empower the team to participate in decision making and take ownership of the provided 
solutions to improve team productivity for more effective and efficient results.
One of the models used to describe team development is the Tuckman ladder, which includes 
five stages of development that teams may go through. Although it is common for these stages to 
occur in order, it is not uncommon for a team to get stuck in a particular stage or regress to an earlier 
stage. Projects with team members who worked together in the past might skip a stage.
▶	 Forming. This phase is where the team members meet and learn about the project and 
their formal roles and responsibilities. Team members tend to be independent and not as 
open in this phase.
▶	 Storming. During this phase, the team begins to address the project work, technical decisions, 
and the project management approach. If team members are not collaborative or open to 
differing ideas and perspectives, the environment can become counterproductive.
▶	 Norming. In this phase, team members begin to work together and adjust their work habits 
and behaviors to support the team. The team members learn to trust each other.
▶	 Performing. Teams that reach the performing stage function as a well-organized unit. They 
are interdependent and work through issues smoothly and effectively.
▶	 Adjourning. In this phase, the team completes the work and moves on from the project. 
This typically occurs when staff is released from the project as deliverables are completed 
or as part of the Close Project or Phase process.
The duration of a particular stage depends upon team dynamics, team size, and team leadership. 
Project managers should have a good understanding of team dynamics in order to move their team 
members through all stages in an effective manner.

6.6  MANAGE TEAM
Manage Team is the process of tracking team member 
performance, providing feedback, resolving issues, and 
managing team changes to optimize project performance. 
The key benefit of this process is that it influences team 
behavior, manages conflict, and resolves issues.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, 
tools and techniques, and outputs are shown in Figure 6-11. 
Figure 6-12 presents the data flow diagram for this process.
Managing a project team requires a variety of manage-
ment and leadership skills for fostering teamwork and  
integrating the efforts of team members to create high-performance 
teams. Team management involves a combination of skills with 
special emphasis on communication, conflict management, 
negotiation, and leadership. Project managers should provide 
challenging assignments to team members and give recognition 
for high performance.

A project manager 
needs to be sensitive 
to both the willingness 
and the ability of team members 
to perform their work and 
adjust their management and 
leadership styles accordingly. 
Team members with low-skill 
abilities will require more 
intensive oversight than those 
who have demonstrated ability 
and experience.

6.7  MANAGE COMMUNICATIONS
Manage Communications is the process of ensuring timely and appropriate collection, creation, 
distribution, storage, retrieval, management, monitoring, and the ultimate disposition of project 
information. The key benefit of this process is that it enables an efficient and effective information 
flow between the project team and the stakeholders.
The Manage Communications process identifies all aspects of effective communication, 
including choice of appropriate technologies, methods, and techniques. In addition, it should allow 
for flexibility in the communications activities, allowing adjustments in the methods and techniques 
to accommodate the changing needs of stakeholders and the project.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs 
are shown in Figure 6-13. Figure 6-14 presents the data flow diagram for this process.

▶	 Sender-receiver models. Incorporate feedback loops to provide opportunities for interaction/
participation and remove barriers to effective communication.
▶	 Choice of media. Make decisions about the application of communications artifacts to 
meet specific project needs, such as when to communicate in writing versus orally, when to 
prepare an informal memo versus a formal report, and when to use push/pull options and 
the choice of appropriate technology.
▶	 Writing style. Use active versus passive voice, sentence structure, and word choice in the 
appropriate manner.
▶	 Meeting management. Prepare an agenda, invite essential participants, and ensure they 
attend. Deal with conflicts within the meeting or those conflicts that result from inadequate 
follow-up of minutes and actions or attendance of the wrong people.
▶	 Presentations. Be aware of the impact of body language and design of visual aids.
▶	 Facilitation. Build consensus and overcome obstacles, such as difficult group dynamics, 
and maintain interest and enthusiasm among group members.
▶	 Active listening. Listen actively by acknowledging, clarifying and confirming, understanding, 
and removing barriers that adversely affect comprehension.
6.8  IMPLEMENT RISK RESPONSES
Implement Risk Responses is the process of implementing agreed-upon risk response plans. 
The key benefit of this process is that it ensures that agreed-upon risk responses are executed as 
planned in order to address overall project risk exposure, minimize individual project threats, and 
maximize individual project opportunities.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs 
are shown in Figure 6-15. Figure 6-16 presents the data flow diagram for this process.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Proper attention to the Implement Risk Responses 
process will ensure that agreed-upon risk responses are 
actually executed. A common problem is that project teams 
spend time and effort to identify and analyze risks and 
develop risk responses, then risk responses are agreed upon 
and documented in the risk register and risk report, but no 
action is taken to manage the risk.
6.9  CONDUCT PROCUREMENTS
Conduct Procurements is the process of obtaining seller 
responses, selecting a seller, and awarding a contract. The key 
benefit of this process is that it selects a qualified seller and 
implements the legal agreement for delivery. The end results 
of the process are the established agreements, including 
formal contracts.
This process is performed periodically throughout the 
project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and 
outputs are shown in Figure 6-17. Figure 6-18 presents the 
data flow diagram for this process.
Only when risk owners 
give the required level  
of effort to implement  
the agreed-upon responses  
will the overall risk exposure of 
the project and individual threats 
and opportunities be managed 
proactively.

Manage Stakeholder Engagement involves activities such as:
▶	 Engage stakeholders at appropriate project stages to obtain, confirm, or maintain their 
continued commitment to the success of the project.
▶	 Manage stakeholder expectations through negotiation and communication.
▶	 Address any risks or potential concerns related to stakeholder management and anticipate 
future issues that may be raised by stakeholders.
▶	 Clarify and resolve issues that have been identified.
Managing stakeholder engagement helps to ensure that stakeholders clearly understand the 
project goals, objectives, benefits, and risks for the project, as well as how their contribution will 
enhance project success.

Monitoring and  
Controlling Process Group
The processes in the Monitoring and Controlling Process Group are shown in Table 7-1.
The Monitoring and Controlling Process Group consists of those processes required to track, 
review, and regulate the progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which 
changes to the plan are required; and initiate the corresponding changes. Monitoring is collecting 
project performance data, producing performance measures, and reporting and disseminating 
performance information. Controlling is comparing actual performance with planned performance, 
analyzing variances, assessing trends to effect process improvements, evaluating possible 
alternatives, and recommending appropriate corrective action as needed.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
The key benefit of this Process Group is that project performance is measured and analyzed 
at regular intervals, appropriate events, or when exception conditions occur in order to identify and 
correct variances from the project management plan. The Monitoring and Controlling Process Group 
also involves the following activities:
▶	 Evaluate change requests and decide on the appropriate response.
▶	 Recommend corrective or preventive action in anticipation of possible problems.
▶	 Monitor the ongoing project activities against the project management plan and project 
baselines.
▶	 Influence the factors that could circumvent the change control process so only approved 
changes are implemented.
Continuous monitoring provides the project team and other stakeholders with insight into the 
status of the project and identifies any areas that require additional attention. The Monitoring and 
Controlling Process Group monitors and controls the work being done within each Process Group, 
each life cycle phase, and the project as a whole. The Monitoring and Controlling Process Group 
includes the project management processes identified in Sections 7.1 through 7.12.
7.1  MONITOR AND CONTROL PROJECT WORK
Monitor and Control Project Work is the process of tracking, reviewing, and reporting the 
overall progress to meet the performance objectives defined in the project management plan. The 
key benefits of this process are that it allows stakeholders to understand the current state of the 
project, to recognize the actions taken to address any performance issues, and to have visibility into 
the future project status with cost and schedule forecasts.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs 
are shown in Figure 7-1. Figure 7-2 presents the data flow diagram for this process.

Monitoring and Controlling Process Group
Monitoring is an aspect of project management performed throughout the project. Monitoring 
includes collecting, measuring, and assessing measurements and trends to effect process improve-
ments. Continuous monitoring gives the project management team insight into the health of the  
project and identifies any areas that may require special attention. Control includes determining 
corrective or preventive actions or replanning and following up on action plans to determine whether 
the actions taken resolved the performance issue. The Monitor and Control Project Work process  
is concerned with:
▶	 Comparing actual project performance against the project management plan;
▶	 Assessing performance periodically to determine whether any corrective or preventive 
actions are indicated, and then recommending those actions as necessary;
▶	 Checking the status of individual project risks;
▶	 Maintaining an accurate, timely information base concerning the project’s product(s) and 
their associated documentation through project completion;
▶	 Providing information to support status reporting, progress measurement, and forecasting;
▶	 Providing forecasts to update current cost and current schedule information;
▶	 Monitoring implementation of approved changes as they occur;
▶	 Providing appropriate reporting on project progress and status to program management 
when the project is part of an overall program; and
▶	 Ensuring that the project stays aligned with the business needs.
7.2  PERFORM INTEGRATED CHANGE CONTROL
Perform Integrated Change Control is the process of reviewing all change requests; approving 
changes and managing changes to deliverables, project documents, and the project management 
plan; and communicating the decisions. This process reviews all requests for changes to project 
documents, deliverables, or the project management plan and determines the resolution of the 
change requests. The key benefit of this process is that it allows for documented changes within the 
project to be considered in an integrated manner while addressing overall project risk, which often 
arises from changes made without consideration of the overall project objectives or plans.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
The Perform Integrated Change Control process is conducted from project start through 
completion and is the ultimate responsibility of the project manager. Change requests can impact 
the project scope and the product scope, as well as any project management plan component or 
any project document. Changes may be requested by any stakeholder involved with the project 
and may occur at any time throughout the project life cycle. The applied level of change control is 
dependent upon the application area, complexity of the specific project, contract requirements,  
and the context and environment in which the project is performed.
Before the baselines are established, changes are not required to be formally controlled by 
the Perform Integrated Change Control process. Once the project is baselined, change requests go 
through this process. As a general rule, each project’s configuration management plan should define 
which project artifacts need to be placed under configuration control. Any change in a configuration 
element should be formally controlled and will require a change request.
Although changes may be initiated verbally, they should be recorded in written form 
and entered into the change management and/or configuration management system. Change 
requests may require information on estimated schedule impacts and estimated cost impacts 
prior to approval. Whenever a change request may impact any of the project baselines, a formal 
integrated change control process is always required. Every documented change request needs to 
be either approved, deferred, or rejected by a responsible individual, usually the project sponsor 
or project manager. The responsible individual will be identified in the project management plan 
or by organizational procedures. When required, the Perform Integrated Change Control process 
includes a change control board (CCB), which is a formally chartered group responsible for 
reviewing, evaluating, approving, deferring, or rejecting changes to the project and for recording 
and communicating such decisions.
Approved change requests can require new or revised cost estimates, activity sequences, 
schedule dates, resource requirements, and/or analysis of risk response alternatives. These 
changes can require adjustments to the project management plan and other project documents. 
Customer or sponsor approval may be required for certain change requests after CCB approval, 
unless they are part of the CCB.

7.3  VALIDATE SCOPE
Validate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. 
The key benefit of this process is that it brings objectivity to the acceptance process and increases the 
probability of final product, service, or result acceptance by validating each deliverable.
This process is performed periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs are shown in Figure 7-5. Figure 7-6 presents the data flow diagram for

The verified deliverables obtained from the Control Quality process are reviewed with the 
customer or sponsor to ensure they are completed satisfactorily and have received formal acceptance 
of the deliverables by the customer or sponsor. In this process, the outputs obtained as a result of the 
Planning processes for scope, such as the requirements documentation or the scope baseline, as well 
as the work performance data obtained from the Executing processes, are the basis for performing 
the validation and for final acceptance.

The Validate Scope process is primarily concerned with acceptance of the deliverables while 
the Control Quality process is primarily concerned with correctness of the deliverables and meeting 
the quality requirements specified for the deliverables. Control Quality is generally performed before 
Validate Scope, although the two processes may be performed in parallel.
7.4  CONTROL SCOPE
Control Scope is the process of monitoring the status of the project and product scope and 
managing changes to the scope baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the scope baseline is 
maintained throughout the project.

Controlling the project scope ensures all requested changes and recommended corrective 
or preventive actions are processed through the Perform Integrated Change Control process 
(see Section 7.2). Control Scope is also used to manage the actual changes when they occur and 
is integrated with the other control processes. The uncontrolled expansion to product or project 
scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources is referred to as scope creep. Change is 
inevitable; therefore, some type of change control process is mandatory for every project.

Updating the schedule model requires knowing the actual performance to date. Any change to 
the schedule baseline can only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process 
(Section 7.2). Control Schedule, as a component of the Perform Integrated Change Control process,  
is concerned with:
▶	 Determining the current status of the project schedule,
▶	 Influencing the factors that create schedule changes,
▶	 Reconsidering necessary schedule reserves,
▶	 Determining if the project schedule has changed, and
▶	 Managing the actual changes as they occur.
When an agile approach is used, Control Schedule is concerned with:
▶	 Determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount 
of work delivered and accepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed 
time cycle;
▶	 Conducting retrospectives (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting 
processes and improving, if required;
▶	 Reprioritizing the remaining work plan (backlog);
▶	 Determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted 
(velocity) in the given time per iteration (agreed-upon work cycle duration, typically  
2 weeks or 1 month);
▶	 Determining that the project schedule has changed; and
▶	 Managing the actual changes as they occur.
When work is being contracted, regular and milestone status updates from contractors and 
suppliers are a means of ensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is 
under control. Scheduled status reviews and walkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor 
reports are accurate and complete.

Updating the budget requires knowledge of the actual costs spent to date. Any increase 
to the authorized budget can only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control 
process (Section 7.2). Monitoring the expenditure of funds without regard to the value of work being 
accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project, other than to track the outflow of 
funds. Much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between the consumption 
of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures. The key to effective cost 
control is the management of the approved cost baseline.
Project cost control includes:
▶	 Influencing the factors that create changes to the authorized cost baseline;
▶	 Ensuring that all change requests are acted on in a timely manner;
▶	 Managing the actual changes when and as they occur;
▶	 Ensuring that cost expenditures do not exceed the authorized funding by period, by WBS 
component, by activity, and in total for the project;
▶	 Monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from the approved  
cost baseline;
▶	 Monitoring work performance against funds expended;
▶	 Preventing unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or resource 
usage;
▶	 Informing appropriate stakeholders of all approved changes and associated cost; and
▶	 Bringing expected cost overruns within acceptable limits.

7.7  CONTROL QUALITY
Control Quality is the process of monitoring and recording results of executing the quality 
management activities in order to assess performance and ensure the project outputs are complete, 
correct, and meet customer expectations. The key benefit of this process is verifying that project 
deliverables and work meet the requirements specified by key stakeholders for final acceptance. The 
Control Quality process determines if the project outputs do what they were intended to do. Those 
outputs need to comply with all applicable standards, requirements, regulations, and specifications.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs

The Control Quality process is performed to measure the completeness, compliance, and 
fitness for use of a product or service prior to user acceptance and final delivery. This is done by 
measuring all steps, attributes, and variables used to verify conformance or compliance to the 
specifications stated during the planning stage.
Quality control should be performed throughout the project to formally demonstrate, with 
reliable data, that the sponsor’s and/or customer’s acceptance criteria have been met.

Monitoring and Controlling Process Group
The level of effort to control quality and the degree of implementation may differ between 
industries and project management styles. For example, in the pharmaceutical, health, transportation, 
and nuclear industries, there may be stricter quality control procedures compared to other industries, 
and the effort needed to meet the standards may be extensive. In agile projects, the Control Quality 
activities may be performed by all team members throughout the project life cycle. In predictive 
(waterfall) model-based projects, the quality control activities are performed at specific times 
toward the end of the project or phase by specified team members.
7.8  CONTROL RESOURCES
Control Resources is the process of ensuring that the physical resources assigned and allocated 
to the project are available as planned, as well as monitoring the planned versus actual utilization of 
resources and taking corrective action as necessary. The key benefit of this process is ensuring that 
the assigned resources are available to the project at the right time and in the right place and are 
released when no longer needed.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs 
are shown in Figure 7-15. Figure 7-16 presents the data flow diagram for this process.

The Control Resources process should be performed continuously in all project phases and 
throughout the project life cycle. The resources needed for the project should be assigned and 
released at the right time, right place, and in the right amount for the project to continue without 
delays. The Control Resources process is concerned with physical resources such as equipment, 
materials, facilities, and infrastructure. Team members are addressed in the Manage Team process.

Monitoring and Controlling Process Group
Updating resource allocation requires knowing what actual 
resources have been used to date and what is still needed. This 
is done mainly by reviewing the performance usage to date. 
Control Resources is concerned with:
▶	 Monitoring resource expenditures,
▶	 Identifying and dealing with resource shortage/
surplus in a timely manner,
▶	 Ensuring that resources are used and released 
according to the plan and project needs,
▶	 Informing appropriate stakeholders if any issues 
arise with relevant resources,
▶	 Influencing the factors that can create resource 
utilization changes, and
▶	 Managing the actual changes as they occur.
Any changes needed to the schedule or cost baselines 
can be approved only through the Perform Integrated Change 
Control process (Section 7.2).
The Control Resources 
techniques discussed 
here are those used 
most frequently on projects. 
There are many others that may 
be useful on certain projects or in 
some application areas.

7.9  MONITOR COMMUNICATIONS
Monitor Communications is the process of ensuring the information needs of the project and 
its stakeholders are met. The key benefit of this process is the optimal information flow as defined 
in the communications management plan and the stakeholder engagement plan.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs are

Monitor Communications determines if the planned communications artifacts and activities have 
had the desired effect of increasing or maintaining stakeholders’ support for the project’s deliverables 
and expected outcomes. The impact and consequences of project communications should be carefully 
evaluated and monitored to ensure that the right message with the right content (the same meaning 
for sender and receiver) is delivered to the right audience, through the right channel, and at the right 
time. Monitor Communications may require a variety of methods, such as customer satisfaction 
surveys, collecting lessons learned, observations of the team, reviewing data from the issue log, or 
evaluating changes in the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix (refer to data representation 
in Section 10, Figure 10-22).

The Monitor Communications process can trigger an iteration of the Plan Communications 
Management and/or Manage Communications processes to improve the effectiveness of communi­
cation through additional and possibly amended communications plans and activities. Such iterations 
illustrate the continuous nature of the communications management processes. Issues or key perfor­
mance indicators, risks, or conflicts may trigger an immediate revision.
7.10  MONITOR RISKS
Monitor Risks is the process of monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response 
plans, tracking identified risks, identifying and analyzing new risks, and evaluating risk process 
effectiveness throughout the project. The key benefit of this process is that it enables project decisions 
to be based on current information about overall project risk exposure and individual project risks.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs 
are shown in Figure 7-19. Figure 7-20 presents the data flow diagram for this process.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
In order to ensure that the project team and key stakeholders are aware of the current level 
of risk exposure, project work should be continuously monitored for new, changing, and outdated 
individual project risks and for changes in the level of overall project risk by applying the Monitor 
Risks process. The Monitor Risks process uses the performance information generated during 
project execution to determine if:
▶	 Implemented risk responses are effective,
▶	 Level of overall project risk has changed,
▶	 Status of identified individual project risks has changed,
▶	 New individual project risks have arisen,
▶	 Risk management approach is still appropriate,
▶	 Project assumptions are still valid,
▶	 Risk management policies and procedures are being followed,
▶	 Contingency reserves for cost or schedule require modification, and
▶	 Project strategy is still valid.
7.11  CONTROL PROCUREMENTS
Control Procurements is the process of managing procurement relationships, monitoring 
contract performance and making changes and corrections as appropriate, and closing out contracts. 
The key benefit of this process is that it ensures that both the seller’s and buyer’s performance meet 
the project’s requirements according to the terms of the legal agreement.
This process is performed throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and 
outputs are shown in Figure 7-21. Figure 7-22 presents the data flow diagram for this process.

Monitoring and Controlling Process Group
Both the buyer and the seller administer the procurement contract for similar purposes. 
Each is required to ensure that both parties meet their contractual obligations and that their own 
legal rights are protected. The legal nature of the relationship makes it imperative that the project 
management team is aware of the implications of actions taken when controlling any procurement. 
On larger projects with multiple providers, a key aspect of contract administration is managing 
communication among the various providers.
Because of the legal aspect, many organizations treat contract administration as an organizational 
function that is separate from the project. While a procurement administrator may be on the project 
team, this individual typically reports to a supervisor from a different department.
Control Procurements includes application of the appropriate project management processes 
to the contractual relationship(s) and integration of the outputs from these processes into the overall 
management of the project. This integration often occurs at multiple levels when there are multiple 
sellers and multiple products, services, or results involved.
Examples of Procurement Administrative Activities
Activities may include:
▶	 Collection of data and management of project records, including maintenance of detailed 
records of physical and financial performance and establishment of measurable procurement 
performance indicators;
▶	 Refinement of procurement plans and schedules;
▶	 Setup for gathering, analyzing, and reporting procurement-related project data and preparation 
of periodic reports to the organization;
▶	 Monitoring the procurement environment so that implementation can be facilitated  
or adjustments made; and
▶	 Payment of invoices.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
The quality of the controls, including the independence and credibility of procurement audits, 
is critical to the reliability of the procurement system. The organization’s code of ethics, its legal 
counsel, and external legal advisory arrangements, including any ongoing anti-corruption initiatives, 
can contribute to proper procurement controls.
Control Procurements has a financial management component that involves monitoring 
payments to the seller. This ensures that payment terms defined within the contract are met and 
that compensation is linked to the seller’s progress as defined in the contract. A principal concern 
when making payments is to ensure there is a close relationship of payments made to the work 
accomplished. A contract that requires payments linked to project outputs and deliverables, rather 
than inputs such as labor hours, has better controls.
Agreements can be amended at any time prior to contract closure by mutual consent in 
accordance with the change control terms of the agreement. Such amendments are typically 
captured in writing.
7.12  MONITOR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Monitor Stakeholder Engagement is the process of monitoring project stakeholder 
relationships and tailoring strategies for engaging stakeholders through the modification of 
engagement strategies and plans. The key benefit of this process is that it maintains or increases 
the efficiency and effectiveness of stakeholder engagement activities as the project evolves and its 
environment changes.
This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs 
are shown in Figure 7-23. Figure 7-24 presents the data flow diagram for this process.

Closing Process Group
The process in the Closing Process Group is shown in Table 8-1.
The Closing Process Group consists of the process(es) performed to formally complete or close 
a project, phase, or contract. This Process Group verifies that the defined processes are completed 
within all Process Groups to close the project or phase, as appropriate, and formally establishes 
that the project or project phase is complete. The key benefit of this Process Group is that phases, 
projects, and contracts are closed out appropriately. While there is only one process in this Process 
Group, organizations may have their own processes associated with project, phase, or contract 
closure. Therefore, the term Process Group is maintained.
This Process Group may also address the early closure of the project, for example, aborted 
projects or canceled projects.

8.1  CLOSE PROJECT OR PHASE
Close Project or Phase is the process of finalizing all activities for the project, phase, or contract. 
The key benefits of this process are the project or phase information is archived, the planned work  
is completed, and organizational team resources are released to pursue new endeavors.
This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and

When closing a project, the project manager reviews the project management plan to ensure 
that all project work is completed and that the project has met its objectives. The activities necessary 
for the administrative closure of the project or phase include, but are not limited to:
▶	 Actions and activities necessary to satisfy completion or exit criteria for the phase or 
project, such as:
▹	
Make certain that all documents and deliverables are up to date and that all issues 
are resolved.
▹	
Confirm the delivery and formal acceptance of deliverables by the customer.
▹	
Ensure that all costs are charged to the project.
▹	
Close project accounts.

Closing Process Group
▶	 Actions and activities necessary to transfer the project’s products, services, or results to 
the next phase or to production and/or operations.
▶	 Collection of suggestions for improving or updating the policies and procedures of the 
organization and sending them to the appropriate organizational unit.
▶	 Actions and activities to measure stakeholder satisfaction.
The Close Project or Phase process also establishes the procedures to investigate and document 
the reasons for actions taken when a project is terminated before completion. To successfully achieve 
this, the project manager needs to engage all of the proper stakeholders in the process.

Inputs and Outputs
All of the inputs and outputs in this section appear in alphabetical order; therefore, no sections 
numbers are assigned.
Accepted deliverables. Products, results, or capabilities produced by a project and validated by the 
project customer or sponsors as meeting their specified acceptance criteria.
The authorized stakeholder who signs off and approves the deliverables should get involved early 
on in the process and provide feedback regarding the quality of the deliverables so that the team 
can assess quality, performance, and recommend necessary changes.
Activity attributes. Activity attributes are multiple attributes associated with each schedule activity 
that can be included within the activity list. Activity attributes include activity codes, predecessor 
activities, successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags, resource requirements, imposed 
dates, constraints, and assumptions.
Activity attributes extend the description of the activity by identifying multiple components associated 
with each activity. The components for each activity evolve over time. During the initial stages of 
the project, they include the unique activity identifier (ID), WBS ID, and activity label or name. When 
completed, they may include activity descriptions, predecessor activities, successor activities, logical 
relationships, leads and lags, resource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions. 
Activity attributes can be used to identify the place where the work needs to be performed, the 
project calendar the activity is assigned to, and the type of effort involved. Activity attributes are used 
for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the planned schedule activities in 
various ways within reports.
Activity list. A documented tabulation of schedule activities that shows the activity description, activity 
identifier, and a sufficiently detailed scope of work description so project team members understand 
what work is to be performed.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Agreements. Any document or communication that defines the initial intentions of a project. This 
can take the form of a contract, service-level agreement, memorandum of understanding (MOU), 
letters of agreement, verbal agreement, purchase order, email, etc.
Agreements can be simple or complex. A complex project may involve multiple contracts 
simultaneously or in sequence. Agreements must comply with local, national, and international 
laws regarding contracts.
All components (of the project management plan). All components of the project management 
plan are an input to this process. These components can be found in Table 1-6 of this practice guide.
Any component (of the project management plan). Any component of the project management 
plan is an input to this process. These components can be found in Table 1-6 of this practice guide.
Approved change requests. Change requests processed according to the change management 
plan by the project manager, change control board, or other designated person are either approved, 
deferred, or rejected.
Approved change requests are implemented via the Direct and Manage Project Work process. Deferred 
or rejected change requests are communicated to the person or group requesting the change.
The dispositions of all change requests are recorded in the change log as a project document update. 
See also change requests.
Assumption log. A project document used to record all assumptions and constraints throughout 
the project life cycle. New assumptions and constraints may be added, and the status of existing 
assumptions and constraints may be updated or closed out.
High-level (strategic and operational) constraints are normally identified in the business case before 
the project is initiated and then flow into the project charter. Lower-level activity and task assumptions 
are generated throughout the project, such as defining technical specifications, estimates, schedule 
activities, risks, etc. The assumption log is used to record all assumptions and constraints throughout 
the project life cycle.
Basis of estimates. Supporting documentation outlining the details used in establishing project 
estimates such as assumptions, constraints, level of detail, ranges, and confidence levels.
Regardless of the level of detail, the basis of estimates should provide a clear and complete under-
standing of how an estimate was derived. Documentation may include how the basis of estimate was 
developed, assumptions made, known constraints, range of possible estimates (e.g., ±10%), confi-
dence level of the final estimate, and individual project risks influencing this estimate.

Inputs and Outputs
Benefits management plan. The documented explanation defining the processes for creating, 
maximizing, and sustaining the benefits provided by a project or program.
The benefits management plan is the document that describes how and when the benefits of the 
project will be delivered and the mechanisms that should be in place to measure those benefits.  
A project benefit is an outcome of actions, behaviors, products, services, or results that provides 
value to the sponsoring organization as well as to the project’s intended beneficiaries. Development 
of the plan begins early in the project life cycle with the definition of the target benefits. The plan 
describes key elements of the benefits and may include the following:
▶	 Target benefits. The expected tangible and intangible value to be gained by the 
implementation of the project; financial value is expressed as net present value (NPV).
▶	 Strategic alignment. The alignment of the project to the business strategies of the 
organization.
▶	 Time frame for realizing benefits. The length of time to realize benefits, for example, 
short-term, long-term, ongoing, or by phase.
▶	 Benefits owner. The person accountable for monitoring, recording, and reporting 
realized benefits throughout the time frame established in the plan.
▶	 Metrics. The direct and indirect measures used to determine benefits realized.
▶	 Assumptions. The factors expected to be in place or to be in evidence.
▶	 Risks. Those risks pertaining to realization of benefit.
The data and information that are documented in the business case and needs assessment are used to 
develop the benefits management plan. The benefits management plan and the project management 
plan include a description of how the business value resulting from the project becomes part of the 
organization’s ongoing operations, including the metrics to be used. The metrics provide verification  
of the business value and validation of the project’s success.
Development and maintenance of the benefits management plan is an iterative activity. It complements 
the business case, project charter, and project management plan. The project manager works with the 
sponsor to ensure that the project charter, project management plan, and benefits management plan 
remain in alignment throughout the life cycle of the project.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Both the business case and the benefits management plan are developed prior to the project 
being initiated. Additionally, both documents are referenced after the project has been completed. 
Therefore, they are considered business documents rather than project documents or components 
of the project management plan. As appropriate, these business documents may be inputs to some 
of the processes involved in managing the project, such as developing the project charter.
Bid documents. Bid documents are used to solicit proposals from prospective sellers. Terms such 
as bid, tender, or quotation are generally used when the seller selection decision is based on price 
(as when buying commercial or standard items), while a term such as proposal is generally used 
when other considerations such as technical capability or technical approach are the most important. 
Specific procurement terminology used may vary by industry and location of the procurement.
Depending on the goods or services needed, the bidding documents can include a request for 
information, request for quotation, request for proposal, or other appropriate documents. The 
conditions involving their use are presented below:
▶	 Request for information (RFI). An RFI is used when more information on the goods 
and services to be acquired is needed from the sellers. It will typically be followed by an 
RFQ or RFP.
▶	 Request for quotation (RFQ). An RFQ is commonly used when more information is needed 
on how vendors would satisfy the requirements and/or how much it will cost.
▶	 Request for proposal (RFP). An RFP is used when there is a problem in the project and the 
solution is not easy to determine. This is the most formal of the “request for” documents 
and has strict procurement rules for content, time line, and seller responses.
The buyer structures bid documents to facilitate both an accurate and complete response from 
each prospective seller and an easy evaluation of the responses. These documents include a 
description of the desired form of the response, the relevant procurement statement of work 
(SOW), and any required contractual provisions.
The complexity and level of detail of the bid documents should be consistent with the value of, 
and risks associated with, the planned procurement. Bid documents are required to be sufficiently 
detailed to ensure consistent, appropriate responses, but flexible enough to allow consideration of 
any seller suggestions for better ways to satisfy the same requirements.

Inputs and Outputs
Business case. A documented economic feasibility study used to establish the validity of the benefits 
of a selected component lacking sufficient definition and that is used as a basis for the authorization 
of further project management activities.
The business case lists the objectives and reasons for project initiation. It helps measure the project 
success at the end of the project against the project objectives. The business case is a project 
business document that is used throughout the project life cycle. The business case may be used 
before project initiation and may result in a go/no-go decision for the project.
Both the business case and the benefits management plan are developed prior to the project 
being initiated. Additionally, both documents are referenced after the project has been completed. 
Therefore, they are considered business documents rather than project documents or components 
of the project management plan. As appropriate, these business documents may be inputs to some 
of the processes involved in managing the project, such as developing the project charter.
Business documents. The business case and benefits management plan contain information about 
the project’s objectives and how the project will contribute to the business goals. Although both 
documents are developed prior to the project, they are reviewed periodically.
In some organizations, the business case and benefits management plan are maintained at the 
program level. The project sponsor is generally accountable for the development and maintenance 
of the project business case document. The project manager is responsible for providing 
recommendations and oversight to keep the project business case, project management plan, 
project charter, and project benefits management plan success measures in alignment with one 
another and with the goals and objectives of the organization.
Change log. A comprehensive list of changes submitted during the project, which includes the 
current status. The disposition of all change requests is recorded in the change log as a project 
document update.
Change management plan. A component of the project management plan that establishes the 
change control board (CCB), documents the extent of its authority, and describes how the change 
control system will be implemented.
The change management plan provides the direction for managing the change control process and 
documents the roles and responsibilities of the CCB.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Change requests. A change request is a formal proposal to modify any document, deliverable,  
or baseline. Change requests may be initiated internally or externally to the project.
When issues are found while project work is being performed, change requests are submitted to 
modify project policies or procedures, project or product scope, project cost or budget, project 
schedule, or the quality of the project or product results. Change requests may include corrective 
action, preventive action, defect repair, or updates that reflect modified or additional ideas or content.
Other change requests cover the needed preventive or corrective actions to eliminate or minimize  
a negative impact later in the project.
Any stakeholder may request a change. Change requests are processed for review and disposition 
through the Perform Integrated Change Control process.
Closed procurements. The buyer, usually through its authorized procurement administrator, 
provides the seller with formal written notice that the contract has been completed. Requirements 
for formal procurement closure are usually defined in the terms and conditions of the contract and 
are included in the procurement management plan. Typically, all deliverables should have been 
provided on time and meet technical and quality requirements, there should be no outstanding 
claims or invoices, and all final payments should have been made. The project management team 
should have approved all deliverables prior to closure.
Communications management plan. The communications management plan is a component of 
the project management plan and describes how project communications will be planned, structured, 
implemented, and monitored for effectiveness. The plan contains the following information:
▶	 Stakeholder communication requirements;
▶	 Information to be communicated, including language, format, content, and level of detail;
▶	 Escalation processes;
▶	 Reason for the distribution of that information;
▶	 Time frame and frequency for the distribution of required information and receipt  
of acknowledgment or response, if applicable;
▶	 Person responsible for communicating the information;
▶	 Person responsible for authorizing release of confidential information;
▶	 Person or groups who will receive the information, including information about their needs, 
requirements, and expectations;

Inputs and Outputs
▶	 Methods or technologies used to convey the information, such as memos, email, press 
releases, or social media;
▶	 Resources allocated for communication activities, including time and budget;
▶	 Method for updating and refining the communications management plan as the project 
progresses and develops, such as when the stakeholder community changes as the project 
moves through different phases;
▶	 Glossary of common terminology;
▶	 Flowcharts of the information flow in the project, workflows with possible sequence  
of authorization, list of reports, meeting plans, etc.; and
▶	 Constraints derived from specific legislation or regulation, technology, organizational 
policies, etc.
The communications management plan can include guidelines and templates for project status 
meetings, project team meetings, virtual meetings, and email messages. The use of a project 
website and project management software can be included if these are to be used in the project.
Configuration management plan. A component of the project management plan that describes 
how to identify and account for project artifacts under configuration control, and how to record and 
report changes to them.
The plan describes how information will be recorded and updated so that the product, service, or result 
remains consistent and/or operative. As a general rule, each project’s configuration management plan 
should define which project artifacts need to be placed under configuration control. Any change in a 
configuration element should be formally controlled and will require a change request.
Cost baseline. The approved version of the time-phased project budget, excluding any management 
reserves, which can be changed only through formal change control procedures and is used as a 
basis for comparison to actual results.
Cost estimates. A cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required 
to complete the activity. It is a prediction that is based on the information known at a given point in 
time. Cost estimates include the identification and consideration of costing alternatives to initiate and 
complete the project. Cost trade-offs and risks should be considered, such as make versus buy, buy 
versus lease, and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Cost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency (i.e., dollars, euros, yen, etc.). In 
some instances, other units of measure, such as staff hours or staff days, may be used to facilitate 
comparisons by eliminating the effects of currency fluctuations.
Cost estimates should be reviewed and refined during the course of the project to reflect additional 
details as they become available and assumptions are tested. The accuracy of a project estimate will 
increase as the project progresses through the project life cycle.
Costs are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project. This includes but is not 
limited to labor, materials, equipment, services, and facilities, as well as special categories such as an 
inflation allowance, cost of financing, or contingency costs. Cost estimates may be presented at the 
activity level or in summary form.
Cost forecasts. Based on the project’s past performance, cost forecasts are used to determine if the 
project is within defined tolerance ranges for budget and to identify any necessary change requests. 
Either a calculated estimate at completion (EAC) value or a bottom-up EAC value is documented and 
communicated to stakeholders.
Cost management plan. A component of a project or program management plan that describes 
how costs will be planned, structured, and controlled. The cost management processes and their 
associated tools and techniques are documented in the cost management plan.
For example, the cost management plan can establish the following:
▶	 Units of measure. Each unit used in measurements (such as staff hours, staff days, or 
weeks for time measures; meters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity 
measures; or lump sum in currency form) is defined for each of the resources.
▶	 Level of precision. This is the degree to which cost estimates will be rounded up or 
down (e.g., US$995.59 to US$1,000), based on the scope of the activities and magnitude 
of the project.
▶	 Level of accuracy. The acceptable range (e.g., ±10%) used in determining realistic cost 
estimates is specified and may include an amount for contingencies.
▶	 Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.5) 
provides the framework for the cost management plan, allowing for consistency with 
the estimates, budgets, and control of costs. The WBS component used for project cost 
accounting is called the control account. Each control account is assigned a unique code or 
account number(s) that links directly to the performing organization’s accounting system.

Inputs and Outputs
▶	 Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring cost performance may be 
specified to indicate an agreed-upon amount of variation to be allowed before some action 
needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically expressed as percentage deviations from the 
baseline plan.
▶	 Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules  
of performance measurement are set. For example, the cost management plan may:
▹	
Define the points in the WBS at which measurement of control accounts will be performed;
▹	
Establish the EVM techniques (e.g., weighted milestones, fixed-formula, percent 
complete, etc.) to be employed; and
▹	
Specify tracking methodologies and the EVM computation equations for calculating 
projected estimate at completion (EAC) forecasts to provide a validity check on the 
bottom-up EAC.
▶	 Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various cost reports are defined.
▶	 Additional details. Additional details about cost management activities include but are 
not limited to:
▹	
Description of strategic funding choices,
▹	
Procedure to account for fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and
▹	
Procedure for project cost recording.
For more specific information regarding earned value management, refer to The Standard for Earned 
Value Management [9].
Deliverables. Unique and verifiable products, results, or capabilities to perform a service that is 
required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project.
Projects are undertaken to fulfill objectives by producing deliverables. Deliverables may be tangible 
or intangible.
Development approach. The development approach defines whether a predictive, adaptive, or 
hybrid development approach will be used.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Duration estimates. Duration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time 
periods that are required to complete an activity, phase, or project. Duration estimates do not include 
any lags. Duration estimates may include some indication of the range of possible results. For example:
▶	 A range of 2 weeks ± 2 days, which indicates that the activity will take at least 8 days and 
not more than 12 (assuming a 5-day work week); or
▶	 A 15% probability of exceeding 3 weeks, which indicates a high probability—85%—that the 
activity will take 3 weeks or less.
Enterprise environmental factors (EEFs). Conditions, not under the immediate control of the 
team, that influence, constrain, or direct the project, program, or portfolio. These conditions can 
be internal and/or external to the organization. EEFs are considered as inputs to many project 
management processes, specifically for most planning processes. These factors may enhance or 
constrain project management options. In addition, these factors may have a positive or negative 
influence on the outcome.
▶	 EEFs internal to the organization:
▹	
Organizational culture, structure, and governance. Examples include vision, mission, 
values, beliefs, cultural norms, leadership style, hierarchy and authority relationships, 
organizational style, ethics, code of conduct, policies, and procedures.
▹	
Geographic distribution of facilities and resources. Examples include factory locations 
and virtual teams.
▹	
Infrastructure. Examples include existing facilities, equipment, organizational telecom-
munications channels, information technology hardware, availability, and capacity.
▹	
Information technology software. Examples include scheduling software tools, 
configuration management systems, web interfaces to other online automated 
systems, and work authorization systems.
▹	
Resource availability. Examples include contracting and purchasing constraints, 
approved providers and subcontractors, and collaboration agreements.
▹	
Employee capability. Examples include existing human resources expertise, skills, 
competencies, and specialized knowledge.

Marketplace conditions. Examples include competitors, market share brand recognition, 
and trademarks.
▹	
Social and cultural influences and issues. Examples include political climate, codes  
of conduct, ethics, and perceptions.
▹	
Legal restrictions. Examples include country or local laws and regulations related to 
security, data protection, business conduct, employment, and procurement.
▹	
Commercial databases. Examples include benchmarking results, standardized cost 
estimating data, industry risk study information, and risk databases.
▹	
Academic research. Examples include industry studies, publications, and  
benchmarking results.
▹

Financial considerations. Examples include currency exchange rates, interest rates, 
inflation rates, tariffs, and geographic location.
▹	
Physical environmental elements. Examples include working conditions, weather,  
and constraints.
Final product, service, or result transition. A product, service, or result, once delivered by the 
project, may be handed over to a different group or organization that will operate, maintain, and 
support it throughout its life cycle.
This output refers to this transition of the final product, service, or result that the project was 
authorized to produce (or in the case of phase closure, the intermediate product, service, or result 
of that phase) from one team to another.
Final report. A summary of project performance, which can include information such as:
▶	 Summary-level description of the project or phase.
▶	 Scope objectives, the criteria used to evaluate the scope, and evidence that the completion 
criteria were met.
▶	 Quality objectives, the criteria used to evaluate the project and product quality, the verification 
and actual milestone delivery dates, and reasons for variances.

▶	 Cost objectives, including the acceptable cost range, actual costs, and reasons for any 
variances.
▶	 Summary of the validation information for the final product, service, or result.
▶	 Schedule objectives, including whether results achieved the benefits that the project was 
undertaken to address. If the benefits are not met at the close of the project, indicate the 
degree to which they were achieved and estimate for future benefits realization.
▶	 Summary of how the final product, service, or result achieved the business needs identified 
in the business plan. If the business needs are not met at the close of the project, indicate 
the degree to which they were achieved and estimate for when the business needs will be 
met in the future.
▶	 Summary of any risks or issues encountered on the project and how they were addressed.
Independent cost estimates. For large procurements, a procuring organization may elect to 
either prepare its own independent estimate or have a cost estimate prepared by an outside 
professional estimator to serve as a benchmark on proposed responses. Significant differences in 
cost estimates can be an indication that the procurement statement of work (SOW) was deficient 
or ambiguous, or that the prospective sellers either misunderstood or failed to respond fully to 
the procurement SOW.
Issue log. A project document where information about issues is recorded and monitored.
Lessons learned register. A project document used to record knowledge gained during a project 
so that it can be used in the current project and entered into the lessons learned repository.
The lessons learned register can include the category and description of the situation. It may also 
include the impact, recommendations, and proposed actions associated with the situation. The 
lessons learned register records challenges, problems, realized risks and opportunities, or other 
content as appropriate.
The lessons learned register is created as an output of the Manage Project Knowledge process early in 
the project. Thereafter it is used as an input and updated as an output in many processes throughout 
the project. The persons or teams involved in the work are also involved in capturing the lessons 
learned. Knowledge can be documented using videos, pictures, audios, or other suitable means that 
ensure the efficiency of the lessons captured.
At the end of a project or phase, the information is transferred to an organizational process asset 
called a lessons learned repository.

Inputs and Outputs
Make-or-buy decisions. Make-or-buy decisions are made regarding the external purchase or internal 
manufacture of a product. A make-or-buy analysis results in a decision as to whether particular work 
can best be accomplished by the project team or needs to be purchased from outside sources.
Milestone list. A milestone list identifies all project milestones and indicates whether the 
milestone is mandatory, such as those required by contract, or optional, such as those based on 
historical information. Milestones have zero duration because they represent a significant point or 
event in a project.
Organizational process assets (OPAs). The plans, processes, documents, templates, and knowledge 
repositories specific to and used by the performing organization. These assets influence the 
management of the project.
OPAs include any artifact, practice, or knowledge from any or all of the performing organizations 
involved in the project that can be used to execute or govern the project. The OPAs also include 
the organization’s lessons learned from previous projects and historical information. OPAs may 
include completed schedules, risk data, and earned value data. OPAs are inputs to many project 
management processes. Since OPAs are internal to the organization, the project team members may 
be able to update and add to the organizational process assets as necessary throughout the project. 
They may be grouped into two categories:
▶	 Processes, documents, and templates. Generally, assets in this category are not updated 
as part of the project work. Processes, documents, and templates are usually established 
by the project management office (PMO) or another function outside of the project. These 
can be updated only by following the appropriate organizational policies associated with 
updating these assets. Some organizations encourage the team to tailor templates, life 
cycles, and checklists for the project. In these instances, the project management team 
should tailor those assets to meet the needs of the project.
▶	 Organizational knowledge repositories. Assets in this category are updated throughout 
the project with project information. For example, information on financial performance, 
lessons learned, performance metrics and issues, and defects are continually updated 
throughout the project.
Organizational process assets updates. Any organizational process asset can be updated as a result 
of a process. Updates include plans, processes, and knowledge repositories specific to and used by the 
performing organization.

Outputs from other processes. Outputs from other processes are integrated to create the project 
management plan. Subsidiary plans and baselines that are an output from other processes are inputs 
to this process. In addition, changes to these documents may necessitate updates to the project 
management plan.
Performance measurement baseline (PMB). An integrated scope, schedule, and cost plan for the 
project work used for comparison to manage, measure, and control project performance.
Physical resource assignments. This documentation records the material, equipment, supplies, 
locations, and other physical resources that will be used during the project. It describes the expected 
resource utilization and whether the resource is internal to the organization or outsourced. Physical 
resource assignments are dynamic and subject to change due to availability, the project, organization, 
environment, or other factors.
Pre-assignment. When physical or team resources for a project are determined in advance, they 
are considered pre-assigned. This situation can occur if the project is the result of specific resources 
being identified as part of a competitive proposal or if the project is dependent upon the expertise 
of particular persons. Pre-assignment might also include the team members who have already 
been assigned in Develop Project Charter Process or other processes before the initial resource 
management plan has been completed.
Probability and impact matrix. A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability 
of each risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. This matrix specifies 
combinations of probability and impact that allow individual project risks to be divided into priority 
groups (see Figure 9-1). Risks can be prioritized for further analysis and planning of risk responses 
based on their probability and impacts. The probability of occurrence for each individual project risk 
is assessed as well as its impact on one or more project objectives if it does occur, using definitions 
of probability and impact for the project as specified in the risk management plan. Individual project 
risks are assigned to a priority level based on the combination of their assessed probability and 
impact, using a probability and impact matrix.
An organization can assess a risk separately for each objective (e.g., cost, time, and scope) by having 
a separate probability and impact matrix for each. Alternatively, it may develop ways to determine 
one overall priority level for each risk, either by combining assessments for different objectives, or by 
taking the highest priority level regardless of which objective is affected.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
The procurement management plan contains the activities to be undertaken during the procurement 
process. It should document whether international competitive bidding, national competitive bidding, 
local bidding, etc., should be done. If the project is financed externally, the sources and availability of 
funding should be aligned with the procurement management plan and the project schedule.
The procurement management plan can include guidance for:
▶	 How procurement will be coordinated with other project aspects, such as project schedule 
development and control processes;
▶	 Timetable of key procurement activities;
▶	 Procurement metrics to be used to manage contracts;
▶	 Stakeholder roles and responsibilities related to procurement, including authority and 
constraints of the project team when the performing organization has a procurement 
department;
▶	 Constraints and assumptions that could affect planned procurements;
▶	 Legal jurisdiction and the currency in which payments will be made;
▶	 Determination of whether independent estimates will be used and whether they are 
needed as evaluation criteria;
▶	 Risk management issues including identifying requirements for performance bonds  
or insurance contracts to mitigate some forms of project risk; and
▶	 Prequalified sellers, if any, to be used.
A procurement management plan can be formal or informal, can be highly detailed or broadly 
framed, and is based upon the needs of each project.
Procurement statement of work. The statement of work (SOW) for each procurement is 
developed from the project scope baseline and defines only that portion of the project scope that 
is to be included within the related contract. The SOW describes the procurement item in sufficient 
detail to allow prospective sellers to determine if they are capable of providing the products, 
services, or results. Sufficient detail can vary based on the nature of the item, the needs of the 
buyer, or the expected contract form. Information included in a SOW can include specifications, 
quantity desired, quality levels, performance data, period of performance, work location, and 
other requirements.

217
Inputs and Outputs
The procurement SOW should be clear, complete, and concise. It includes a description of any 
collateral services required, such as performance reporting or post-project operational support 
for the procured item. The SOW can be revised as required as it moves through the procurement 
process until incorporated into a signed agreement.
The phrase terms of reference (TOR) is sometimes used when contracting for services. Similar to the 
procurement SOW, a TOR typically includes these elements:
▶	 Tasks the contractor is required to perform as well as specified coordination requirements;
▶	 Standards the contractor will fulfill that are applicable to the project;
▶	 Data that need to be submitted for approval;
▶	 Detailed list of all data and services that will be provided to the contractor by the buyer for 
use in performing the contract, if applicable; and
▶	 Definition of the schedule for initial submission and the review/approval time required.
Procurement strategy. Once the make-or-buy analysis is complete and the decision is made to 
acquire from outside the project, a procurement strategy should be identified. The objective of 
the procurement strategy is to determine the project delivery method, the type of legally binding 
agreement(s), and how the procurement will advance through the procurement phases.
▶	 Delivery methods. Delivery methods are different for professional services versus 
construction projects.
▹	
For professional services, delivery methods include: buyer/services provider with no 
subcontracting, buyer/services provider with subcontracting allowed, joint venture 
between buyer and services provider, and buyer/services provider acts as the 
representative.
▹	
For industrial or commercial construction, project delivery methods include but are not 
limited to: turnkey, design build (DB), design bid build (DBB), design build operate 
(DBO), build own operate transfer (BOOT), and others.
▶	 Contract payment types. Contract payment types are separate from the project delivery 
methods and are coordinated with the buying organization’s internal financial systems. 
They include but are not limited to these contract types plus variations: lump sum, firm 
fixed price, cost plus fixed fee, cost plus award fees, cost plus incentive fees, time and 
materials, target cost, and others.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
▹	
Fixed-price contracts are suitable when the type of work is predictable and the 
requirements are well defined and not likely to change.
▹	
Cost plus contracts are suitable when the work is evolving, likely to change,  
or not well defined.
▹	
Incentives and awards may be used to align the objectives of buyer and seller.
▶	 Procurement phases. The procurement strategy can also include information on 
procurement phases. Information may include:
▹	
Sequencing or phasing of the procurement, a description of each phase and the 
specific objectives of each phase;
▹	
Procurement performance indicators and milestones to be used in monitoring;
▹	
Criteria for moving from phase to phase;
▹	
Monitoring and evaluation plan for tracking progress; and
▹	
Process for knowledge transfer for use in subsequent phases.
Project calendars. A project calendar identifies working days and shifts that are available for 
scheduled activities. It distinguishes time periods in days or parts of days that are available to 
complete scheduled activities from time periods that are not available for work. A schedule model 
may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods for some activities 
to calculate the project schedule. Project calendars may be updated.
Project charter. A document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that formally authorizes the 
existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational 
resources to project activities.
Project communications. Project communications artifacts may include but are not limited to: 
performance reports, deliverable status, schedule progress, cost incurred, presentations, and other 
information required by stakeholders.
Project documents. The documentation created throughout the five Process Groups to initiate, 
plan, execute, manage and control, close, and deliver the project. There are 33 project documents 
listed in Table 1-6 of this practice guide. Examples include change log, issue log, project schedule, 
project scope statement, requirements documentation, risk register, and stakeholder register.

Project documents updates. The documentation that is updated throughout the five Process 
Groups to initiate, plan, execute, manage and control, close, and deliver the project. There are  
33 project documents listed in Table 1-6 of this practice guide. Examples include change log, issue 
log, project schedule, project scope statement, requirements documentation, risk register, and 
stakeholder register.
Project funding requirements. Total funding requirements and periodic funding requirements 
(e.g., quarterly, annually) are derived from the cost baseline. The cost baseline includes projected 
expenditures plus anticipated liabilities. Funding often occurs in incremental amounts, and may 
not be evenly distributed, which appear as steps in Figure 9-2. The total funds required are those 
included in the cost baseline plus management reserves, if any. Funding requirements may include 
the source(s) of the funding. The budget at completion (BAC) is the sum of all budgets established for 
the work to be performed.
Project life cycle description. The project life cycle determines the series of phases that a project 
passes through from its inception to the end of the project.
Project management plan. The document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored 
and controlled, and closed.

Project management plan updates. Updates to the document that describes how the project is being 
executed, monitored and controlled, and closed.
Project schedule. A schedule model output that presents linked activities with planned dates, 
durations, milestones, and resources. The detailed project schedule should be flexible throughout 
the project to adjust for the knowledge gained, increased understanding of the risks, and value-
added activities.
Project schedule network diagrams. A project schedule network diagram is a graphical 
representation of the logical relationships, also referred to as dependencies, among the project 
schedule activities. Figure 9-3 illustrates a project schedule network diagram. A project schedule 
network diagram is produced manually or by using project management software. It can include 
full project details or have one or more summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany 
the diagram and describe the basic approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity 
sequences within the network should be fully described within the narrative.
Activities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence. Activities that have 
multiple successor activities indicate a path divergence. Activities with divergence and convergence 
are at greater risk as they are affected by multiple activities or can affect multiple activities. Activity 
I is called a path convergence, as it has more than one predecessor, while activity K is called a path 
divergence, as it has more than one successor.

Inputs and Outputs
Project scope statement. The project scope statement includes the description of the project 
scope, major deliverables, and exclusions. The project scope statement documents the entire 
scope, including project and product scope. It describes the project’s deliverables in detail. It also 
provides a common understanding of the project scope among project stakeholders. It may contain 
explicit scope exclusions that can assist in managing stakeholder expectations. It enables the 
project team to perform more detailed planning, guides the project team’s work during execution, 
and provides the baseline for evaluating whether requests for changes or additional work are 
contained within or outside the project’s boundaries.
The degree and level of detail to which the project scope statement defines the work that will be 
performed and the work that is excluded, can help determine how well the project management 
team can control the overall project scope. The detailed project scope statement, either directly  
or by reference to other documents, includes the following:
▶	 Product scope description. Progressively elaborates the characteristics of the product, 
service, or result described in the project charter and requirements documentation.
▶	 Deliverables. Any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service 
that is required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables also 
include ancillary results, such as project management reports and documentation. These 
deliverables may be described at a summary level or in great detail.
▶	 Acceptance criteria. A set of conditions that is required to be met before deliverables 
are accepted.
▶	 Project exclusions. Identifies what is excluded from the project. Explicitly stating what 
is out of scope for the project helps manage stakeholders’ expectations and can reduce 
scope creep.

Although the project charter and the project scope statement are sometimes perceived as containing 
a certain degree of redundancy, they are different in the level of detail contained in each. The project 
charter contains high-level information, while the project scope statement contains a detailed 
description of the scope components. These components are progressively elaborated throughout 
the project. Table 9-1 describes some of the key elements for each document.

Project team assignments. A document containing a record of the team members and their roles and 
responsibilities for the project. This documentation can include a project team directory and names 
inserted into the project management plan, such as the project organization charts and schedules.
Quality control measurements. The documented results of the Control Quality process activities. 
The measurements should be captured in the format specified in the quality management plan.
Quality management plan. The quality management plan is a component of the project 
management plan and describes how applicable policies, procedures, and guidelines will be 
implemented to achieve the quality objectives. It describes the activities and resources necessary 
for the project management team to achieve the quality objectives set for the project. The quality 
management plan may be formal or informal, detailed or broadly framed. The style and detail of the 
quality management plan are determined by the requirements of the project. It should be reviewed 
early in the project to ensure that decisions are based on accurate information. The benefits of this 
review can include a sharper focus on the project’s value proposition, reductions in costs, and less 
frequent schedule overruns that are caused by rework.
The quality management plan may include but is not limited to the following components:
▶	 Quality standards that will be used by the project,
▶	 Quality objectives of the project,
▶	 Quality roles and responsibilities,
▶	 Project deliverables and processes subject to quality review,
▶	 Quality control and quality management activities planned for the project,
▶	 Quality tools that will be used for the project, and
▶	 Major procedures relevant for the project, such as dealing with nonconformance,  
corrective actions procedures, and continuous improvement procedures.
Quality metrics. A quality metric specifically describes a project or product attribute and how 
the Control Quality process will verify compliance to it. Some examples of quality metrics include 
percentage of tasks completed on time, cost performance measured by a cost performance index 
(CPI), failure rate, number of defects identified per day, total downtime per month, errors found per 
line of code, customer satisfaction scores, and percentage of requirements covered by the test plan 
as a measure of test coverage.

Quality report. A project document that includes quality management issues, recommendations 
for corrective actions, and a summary of findings from quality control activities. It may include 
recommendations for process, project, and product improvements.
Quality reports can be graphical, numerical, or qualitative. The information provided can 
be used by other processes and departments to take corrective actions in order to achieve the 
expected quality. Information presented in the quality reports may include all quality management 
issues escalated by the team; recommendations for process, project, and product improvements; 
corrective actions recommendations (including rework, defect/bugs repair, 100% inspection, and 
more); and the summary of findings from the Control Quality process.
Requirements documentation. A description of how individual requirements meet the business 
need for the project.
Requirements may start out at a high level and become progressively more detailed as more 
information about the requirements becomes known. Before being baselined, requirements need 
to be unambiguous (measurable and testable), traceable, complete, consistent, and acceptable to 
key stakeholders. The format of the requirements document may range from a simple document 
listing all of the requirements categorized by stakeholder and priority, to more elaborate forms 
containing an executive summary, detailed descriptions, and attachments.
Many organizations categorize requirements into different types, such as business and technical 
solutions. Business solutions refer to stakeholder needs and technical solutions determine how those 
needs will be implemented. Requirements can be grouped into classifications allowing for further 
refinement and detail as the requirements are elaborated. These classifications include:
▶	 Business requirements. These describe the higher-level needs of the organization as 
a whole, such as business issues or opportunities, and reasons why a project has been 
undertaken.
▶	 Stakeholder requirements. These describe the needs of a stakeholder or stakeholder group.
▶	 Solution requirements. These describe features, functions, and characteristics of the 
product, service, or result that will meet the business and stakeholder requirements. 
Solution requirements are further grouped into functional and nonfunctional 
requirements:

Functional requirements. Functional requirements describe the behaviors of the product. 
Examples include actions, processes, data, and interactions that the product should 
execute.
▹	
Nonfunctional requirements. Nonfunctional requirements supplement functional 
requirements and describe the environmental conditions or qualities required for the 
product to be effective. Examples include reliability, security, performance, safety, level 
of service, supportability, retention/purge, etc.

as data conversion and training requirements, needed to transition from the current as-is 
state to the desired future state.
▶	 Project requirements. These describe the actions, processes, or other conditions the project 
needs to meet. Examples include milestone dates, contractual obligations, constraints, etc.
▶	 Quality requirements. These capture any condition or criteria needed to validate the 
successful completion of a project deliverable or fulfillment of other project requirements. 
Examples include tests, certifications, validations, etc.
Requirements management plan. The requirements management plan is a component of the 
project management plan and describes how project and product requirements will be analyzed, 
documented, and managed. According to Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide [3], some 
organizations refer to it as a business analysis plan. Components of the requirements management 
plan can include but are not limited to:
▶	 How requirements activities will be planned, tracked, and reported;
▶	 Configuration management activities, such as:
▹	
How changes will be initiated;
▹	
How impacts will be analyzed;
▹	
How changes will be traced, tracked, and reported; and
▹

Requirements traceability matrix. The requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links 
product requirements from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them. The implementation 
of a requirements traceability matrix helps to ensure that each requirement adds business value 
by linking it to the business and project objectives. It provides a means to track requirements 
throughout the project life cycle, helping to ensure that requirements approved in the requirements 
documentation are delivered at the end of the project. Finally, it provides a structure for managing 
changes to the product scope.
Tracing requirements includes but is not limited to:
▶	 Business needs, opportunities, goals, and objectives;
▶	 Project objectives;
▶	 Project scope and WBS deliverables;
▶	 Product design;
▶	 Product development;
▶	 Test strategy and test scenarios; and
▶	 High-level requirements to more detailed requirements.
Attributes associated with each requirement can be recorded in the requirements traceability 
matrix. These attributes help to define key information about the requirement. Typical attributes 
used in the requirements traceability matrix may include: a unique identifier, a textual description  
of the requirement, the rationale for inclusion, owner, source, priority, version, current status  
(e.g., active, cancelled, deferred, added, approved, assigned, completed), and status date. Additional 
attributes to ensure that the requirement has met stakeholders’ satisfaction may include stability, 
complexity, and acceptance criteria. Figure 9-4 provides an example of a requirements traceability 
matrix with its associated attributes.
Resource breakdown structure. A hierarchical representation of resources by category and type. 
Examples of resource categories include but are not limited to labor, material, equipment, and 
supplies. Resource types may include the skill level, grade level, required certifications, or other 
information as appropriate to the project. See Figure 9-5 for an example.

Resource calendars. A resource calendar identifies the working days, shifts, start and end of normal 
business hours, weekends, and public holidays when each specific resource is available. Information 
on which resources (such as team resource, equipment, and material) are potentially available during 
a planned activity period is used for estimating resource utilization. Resource calendars also specify 
when, and for how long, identified team and physical resources will be available during the project. 
This information may be at the activity or project level. This includes consideration of attributes such 
as resource experience and/or skill level, as well as various geographical locations.
Resource management plan. The resource management plan is a component of the project 
management plan that provides guidance on how project resources should be categorized, allocated, 
managed, and released. It may be divided between the team management plan and physical resource 
management plan according to the specifics of the project. The resource management plan may 
include but is not limited to:
▶	 Identification of resources. Methods for identifying and quantifying team and physical 
resources needed.
▶	 Acquiring resources. Guidance on how to acquire team and physical resources for the project.
▶	 Roles and responsibilities:
▹	
Role. The function assumed by, or assigned to, a person in the project. Examples of 
project roles are civil engineer, business analyst, and testing coordinator.
▹	
Authority. The right to apply project resources, make decisions, sign approvals, accept 
deliverables, and influence others to carry out the work of the project. Examples of 
decisions that need clear authority include the selection of a method for completing 
an activity, quality acceptance criteria, and how to respond to project variances. Team 
members operate best when their individual levels of authority match their individual 
responsibilities.
▹	
Responsibility. The assigned duties and work that a project team member is expected 
to perform in order to complete the project’s activities.
▹	
Competence. The skill and capacity required to complete assigned activities within the 
project constraints. If project team members do not possess required competencies, 
performance can be jeopardized. When such mismatches are identified, proactive 
responses such as training, hiring, schedule changes, or scope changes are initiated.

▶	 Project organization charts. A project organization chart is a graphic display of project 
team members and their reporting relationships. It can be formal or informal, highly 
detailed or broadly framed, based on the needs of the project. For example, the project 
organization chart for a 3,000-person disaster response team will have greater detail than 
a project organization chart for an internal, 20-person project.
▶	 Project team resource management. Guidance on how project team resources should 
be defined, staffed, managed, and eventually released.
▶	 Training. Training strategies for team members.
▶	 Team development. Methods for developing the project team.
▶	 Resource control. Methods for ensuring adequate physical resources are available as 
needed and that the acquisition of physical resources is optimized for project needs. 
Includes information on managing inventory, equipment, and supplies throughout the 
project life cycle.
▶	 Recognition plan. Which recognition and rewards will be given to team members, and 
when they will be given.
Resource requirements. Resource requirements identify the types and quantities of resources 
required for each work package or activity in a work package and can be aggregated to determine the 
estimated resources for each work package, each WBS branch, and the entire project. The amount of 
detail and the level of specificity of the resource requirement descriptions can vary by application area. 
The resource requirements’ documentation can include assumptions that were made in determining 
which types of resources are applied, their availability, and what quantities are needed.
Risk register. A repository in which outputs of risk processes are recorded. The risk register captures 
details of identified individual project risks. Record the results of the following processes in the risk 
register as these processes are conducted throughout the project:
▶	 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis,
▶	 Plan Risk Responses,
▶	 Implement Risk Responses, and
▶	 Monitor Risks.
The risk register may contain limited or extensive risk information depending on project variables 
such as size and complexity.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
When the Identify Risks process is performed, the content of the risk register may include but is not 
limited to:
▶	 List of identified risks. Each individual project risk is given a unique identifier in the risk 
register. Identified risks are described in as much detail as required to ensure unambiguous 
understanding. A structured risk statement may be used to distinguish risks from their 
cause(s) and their effect(s).
▶	 Potential risk owners. Where a potential risk owner has been identified during the Identify 
Risks process, the risk owner is recorded in the risk register. This will be confirmed during 
the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process.
▶	 List of potential risk responses. Where a potential risk response has been identified 
during the Identify Risks process, it is recorded in the risk register. This will be confirmed 
during the Plan Risk Responses process.
Additional data may be recorded for each identified risk, depending on the risk register format 
specified in the risk management plan. This may include:
▶	 Short risk title,
▶	 Risk category,
▶	 Current risk status,
▶	 One or more causes,
▶	 One or more effects on objectives,
▶	 Risk triggers (events or conditions that indicate that a risk is about to occur),
▶	 WBS reference of affected activities, and
▶	 Timing information (when risk was identified, when risk might occur, when risk may no 
longer be relevant, and the deadline for taking action).

Inputs and Outputs
Risk management plan. The risk management plan is a component of the project management 
plan and describes how risk management activities will be structured and performed. The risk 
management plan may include some or all of the following elements:
▶	 Risk strategy. Describes the general approach to managing risk on this project.
▶	 Methodology. Defines the specific approaches, tools, and data sources that will be used 
to perform risk management on the project.
▶	 Roles and responsibilities. Defines the lead, support, and risk management team 
members for each type of activity described in the risk management plan and clarifies 
their responsibilities.
▶	 Funding. Identifies the funds needed to perform activities related to the management  
of risk. Establishes protocols for the application of contingency and management reserves.
▶	 Timing. Defines when and how often the risk processes will be performed throughout 
the project life cycle and establishes risk management activities for inclusion into the 
project schedule.
▶	 Risk categories. Provide a means for grouping individual project risks. A common way to 
structure risk categories is with a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which is a hierarchical 
representation of potential sources of risk (see example in Figure 9-6). An RBS helps the 
project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may 
arise. This can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identified risks. The 
organization may have a generic RBS to be used for all projects, or there may be several RBS 
frameworks for different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored RBS. Where 
an RBS is not used, an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework, which 
may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectives.

Inputs and Outputs
▶	 Stakeholder risk appetite. The risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are 
recorded in the risk management plan, as they inform the details of the Plan Risk 
Management process. Stakeholder risk appetite should be expressed as measurable risk 
thresholds around each project objective. These thresholds will determine the acceptable 
level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the definitions of 
probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.
▶	 Definitions of risk probability and impacts. Definitions of risk probability and impact 
levels are specific to the project context and reflect the risk appetite and thresholds of 
the organization and key stakeholders. The project may generate specific definitions of 
probability and impact levels, or it may start with general definitions provided by the 
organization. The number of levels reflects the degree of detail required for the risk 
process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically five levels), and 
fewer for a simple process (usually three). Table 9-2 provides an example of definitions 
of probability and impacts against three project objectives. These scales can be used to 
evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact definitions as negative 
for threats (delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall) and positive for opportunities 
(reduced time or cost, and performance enhancement).

Risk report. The risk report presents information on sources of overall project risk, together with 
summary information on identified individual project risks. The risk report is developed progressively 
throughout the risk processes. Include the results of the following processes in the risk report as 
these processes are completed:
▶	 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis,
▶	 Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis,
▶	 Plan Risk Responses,
▶	 Implement Risk Responses, and
▶	 Monitor Risks.
When the Identify Risks process is completed, information in the risk report may include but is not 
limited to:
▶	 Sources of overall project risk, indicating which are the most important drivers of overall 
project risk exposure; and
▶	 Summary information on identified individual project risks, such as number of identified 
threats and opportunities, distribution of risks across risk categories, metrics and trends, etc.
Additional information may be included in the risk report, depending on the reporting requirements 
specified in the risk management plan.
Schedule baseline. The approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through 
formal change control procedures and is used as the basis for comparison to actual results. It is 
accepted and approved by the appropriate stakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start 
dates and baseline finish dates. During monitoring and controlling, the approved baseline dates are 
compared to the actual start and finish dates to determine if variances have occurred. The schedule 
baseline is a component of the project management plan.
Schedule data. The schedule data for the project schedule model is the collection of information 
for describing and controlling the schedule. The schedule data includes, at a minimum, the schedule 
milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes, and documentation of all identified assumptions 
and constraints. The amount of additional data varies by application area. Information frequently 
supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to:

Inputs and Outputs
▶	 Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of a resource histogram;
▶	 Alternative schedules, such as best case or worst case, not resource-leveled or resource-
leveled, or with or without imposed dates; and
▶	 Applied schedule reserves.
Schedule data could also include such items as resource histograms, cashflow projections, order and 
delivery schedules, or other relevant information.
Schedule forecasts. Estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the project’s future based 
on information and knowledge available at the time the schedule is calculated. Forecasts are updated 
and reissued based on work performance information provided as the project is executed. The 
information is based on the project’s past performance and expected future performance based on 
corrective or preventive actions. This can include earned value performance indicators, as well as 
schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future.
Schedule management plan. A component of the project or program management plan that 
establishes the criteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. 
The schedule management plan may be formal or informal, highly detailed or broadly framed based 
on the needs of the project, and it includes appropriate control thresholds.
The schedule management plan can establish the following:
▶	 Project schedule model development. The scheduling methodology and the scheduling 
tool to be used in the development of the project schedule model are specified.
▶	 Release and iteration length. When using an adaptive life cycle, the timeboxed periods 
for releases, waves, and iterations are specified. Timeboxed periods are durations during 
which the team works steadily toward completion of a goal. Timeboxing helps to minimize 
scope creep as it forces the teams to process essential features first, then other features 
when time permits.
▶	 Level of accuracy. The level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining 
realistic activity duration estimates and may include an amount for contingencies.
▶	 Units of measure. Each unit of measurement (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for 
time measures, or meters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures)  
is defined for each of the resources.

▶	 Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) provides the 
framework for the schedule management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates 
and resulting schedules.
▶	 Project schedule model maintenance. The process used to update the status and record 
progress of the project in the schedule model during the execution of the project is defined.
▶	 Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring schedule performance may be 
specified to indicate an agreed-upon amount of variation to be allowed before some action 
needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically expressed as percentage deviations from the 
parameters established in the baseline plan.
▶	 Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules or other 
physical measurement rules of performance measurement are set. For example, the 
schedule management plan may specify:
▹	
Rules for establishing percent complete,
▹	
EVM techniques (e.g., baselines, fixed-formula, percent complete, etc.) to be 
employed (for more specific information, refer to the Standard for Earned Value 
Management [9]), and
▹	
Schedule performance measurements, such as schedule variance (SV) and schedule 
performance index (SPI), used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original 
schedule baseline.
▶	 Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are defined.
Scope baseline. The approved version of a scope statement, work breakdown structure (WBS), and 
its associated WBS dictionary, which can be changed using formal change control procedures and is 
used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is a component of the project management plan. 
Components of the scope baseline include:
▶	 Project scope statement. The project scope statement includes the description of the 
project scope, major deliverables, and exclusions.
▶	 WBS. The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried 
out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required 
deliverables. Each descending level of the WBS represents an increasingly detailed 
definition of the project work.

Inputs and Outputs
▹	
Work package. The lowest level of the WBS is a work package with a unique identifier. 
These identifiers provide a structure for hierarchical summation of costs, schedule, 
and resource information and form a code of accounts. Each work package is part of 
a control account. A control account is a management control point where the scope, 
budget, and schedule are integrated and compared to the earned value for performance 
measurement. A control account has two or more work packages, though each work 
package is associated with a single control account.
▹	
Planning package. A control account may include one or more planning packages. A 
planning package is a WBS component below the control account and above the work 
package with known work content but without detailed schedule activities.
▶	 WBS dictionary. The WBS dictionary is a document that provides detailed deliverable, 
activity, and scheduling information about each component in the WBS. The WBS dictionary 
is a document that supports the WBS. Most of the information included in the WBS 
dictionary is created by other processes and added to this document at a later stage. 
Information in the WBS dictionary may include but is not limited to:
▹	
Code of account identifier,
▹	
Description of work,
▹	
Assumptions and constraints,
▹	
Responsible organization,
▹	
Schedule milestones,
▹	
Associated schedule activities,
▹

▹	
Cost estimates,
▹	
Quality requirements,
▹

Scope management plan. The scope management plan is a component of the project management 
plan and describes how the scope will be defined, developed, monitored, controlled, and validated. 
The components of a scope management plan include:
▶	 Process for preparing a project scope statement,
▶	 Process that enables the creation of the work breakdown structure (WBS) from the detailed 
project scope statement,
▶	 Process that establishes how the scope baseline will be approved and maintained, and
▶	 Process that specifies how formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables will 
be obtained.
The scope management plan can be formal or informal, broadly framed or highly detailed, based on 
the needs of the project.
Selected sellers. The selected sellers are those who have been judged to be in a competitive range 
based on the outcome of the proposal or bid evaluation. Final approval of complex, high-value, high-
risk procurements will generally require organizational senior management approval prior to award.
Seller proposals. Seller proposals are prepared in response to a bid document package and form 
the basic information that will be used by an evaluation body to select one or more successful 
bidders (sellers). If the seller is going to submit a price proposal, good practice is to require that 
it be separate from the technical proposal. The evaluation body reviews each submitted proposal 
according to the source selection criteria and selects the seller that can best satisfy the buying 
organization’s requirements.
Source selection criteria. In choosing evaluation criteria, the buyer seeks to ensure that the 
proposal selected will offer the best quality for the services required. The source selection criteria 
may include but are not limited to:
▶	 Capability and capacity;
▶	 Product cost and life cycle cost;
▶	 Delivery dates;
▶	 Technical expertise and approach;
▶	 Specific relevant experience;

Inputs and Outputs
▶	 Adequacy of the proposed approach and work plan in responding to the SOW;
▶	 Key staff’s qualifications, availability, and competence;
▶	 Financial stability of the firm;
▶	 Management experience; and
▶	 Suitability of the knowledge transfer program, including training.
For international projects, evaluation criteria may include “local content” requirements, for example, 
participation by nationals among proposed key staff.
The specific criteria may be a numerical score, color-code, or a written description of how well the seller 
satisfies the buying organization’s needs. The criteria will be part of a weighting system that can be 
used to select a single seller that will be asked to sign a contract and establish a negotiating sequence 
by ranking all of the proposals by the weighted evaluation scores assigned to each proposal.
Stakeholder engagement plan. The stakeholder engagement plan is a component of the project 
management plan that identifies the strategies and actions required to promote productive 
involvement of stakeholders in decision making and execution. It can be formal or informal and highly 
detailed or broadly framed, based on the needs of the project and the expectations of stakeholders.
The stakeholder engagement plan may include but is not limited to specific strategies or approaches 
for engaging with individuals or groups of stakeholders.
Stakeholder register. A project document including the identification, assessment, and classification 
of project stakeholders. This document contains information about identified stakeholders that 
includes but is not limited to:
▶	 Identification information. Name, organizational position, location and contact details, 
and role on the project.
▶	 Assessment information. Major requirements, expectations, potential for influencing 
project outcomes, and the phase of the project life cycle where the stakeholder has the 
most influence or impact.
▶	 Stakeholder classification. Internal/external, impact/influence/power/interest, upward/
downward/outward/sideward, or any other classification model chosen by the project 
manager.

Team charter. The team charter is a document that establishes the team values, agreements, and 
operating guidelines for the team. The team charter may include but is not limited to:
▶	 Team values,
▶	 Communication guidelines,
▶	 Decision-making criteria and process,
▶	 Conflict resolution process,
▶	 Meeting guidelines, and
▶	 Team agreements.
The team charter establishes clear expectations regarding acceptable behavior by project team 
members. Early commitment to clear guidelines decreases misunderstandings and increases 
productivity. Discussing areas such as codes of conduct, communication, decision making, and 
meeting etiquette allows team members to discover values that are important to one another. The 
team charter works best when the team develops it, or at least has an opportunity to contribute to 
it. All project team members share responsibility for ensuring the rules documented in the team 
charter are followed. The team charter can be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure a 
continued understanding of the team ground rules and to orient and integrate new team members.
Team performance assessments. As project team development efforts such as training, team 
building, and colocation are implemented, the project management team makes formal or informal 
assessments of the project team’s effectiveness. Effective team development strategies and activities 
are expected to increase the team’s performance, which increases the likelihood of meeting project 
objectives.
The evaluation of a team’s effectiveness may include indicators such as:
▶	 Improvements in skills that allow individuals to perform assignments more effectively,
▶	 Improvements in competencies that help team members perform better as a team,
▶	 Reduced staff turnover rate, and
▶	 Increased team cohesiveness where team members share information and experiences 
openly and help each other to improve the overall project performance.

As a result of conducting an evaluation of the team’s overall performance, the project management 
team can identify the specific training, coaching, mentoring, assistance, or changes required to 
improve the team’s performance. This should also include identifying the appropriate or required 
resources necessary to achieve and implement the improvements identified in the assessment.
Test and evaluation documents. Project documents that describe the activities used to determine if 
the product meets the quality objectives stated in the quality management plan. Test and evaluation 
documents can be created based on industry needs and the organization’s templates. They are 
used to evaluate the achievement of the quality objectives. These documents may include dedicated 
checklists and detailed requirements traceability matrices as part of the document.
Verified deliverables. Completed project deliverables that have been checked and confirmed for 
correctness through the Control Quality process. A goal of the Control Quality process is to determine 
the correctness of deliverables. The results of performing the Control Quality process are verified 
deliverables that become an input to the Validate Scope process for formalized acceptance. If there 
were any change requests or improvements related to the deliverables, they may be changed, 
inspected, and reverified.
Virtual teams. Groups of people with a shared goal who fulfill their roles with little or no time spent 
meeting face to face.
The use of virtual teams creates new possibilities when acquiring project team members. Virtual 
teams can be defined as groups of people with a shared goal who fulfill their roles with little or no 
time spent meeting face to face. The availability of communication technology such as email, audio 
conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and videoconferencing has made virtual teams 
feasible. The virtual team model makes it possible to:
▶	 Form teams of people from the same organization who live in widespread geographic areas;
▶	 Add special expertise to a project team even though the expert is not in the same 
geographic area;
▶	 Incorporate employees who work from home offices;
▶	 Form teams of people who work different shifts, hours, or days;

▶	 Include people with mobility limitations or disabilities;
▶	 Move forward with projects that would have been held or canceled due to travel 
expenses; and
▶	 Save the expense of offices and all physical equipment needed for employees.
The use of virtual teams can bring benefits such as the use of more skilled resources, reduced costs, 
less travel and relocation expenses, and the proximity of team members to suppliers, customers, or 
other key stakeholders. Virtual teams can use technology to create an online team environment where 
the team can store files, use conversations threads to discuss issues, and keep a team calendar.
Communication planning becomes increasingly important in a virtual team environment. Additional 
time may be needed to set clear expectations, facilitate communications, develop protocols for 
resolving conflicts, include people in decision making, understand cultural differences, and share 
credit in successes.
Work performance data. The raw observations and measurements identified during activities 
being performed to carry out the project work. Data are often viewed as the lowest level of detail 
from which information is derived by other processes. Data are gathered through work execution 
and passed to the controlling processes for further analysis.
Examples of work performance data include work completed, key performance indicators (KPIs), 
technical performance measures, actual start and finish dates of schedule activities, story points 
completed, deliverables status, schedule progress, number of change requests, number of defects, 
actual costs incurred, actual durations, etc.
Work performance information. The performance data collected from controlling processes, 
analyzed in comparison with project management plan components, project documents, and other 
work performance information.
To become work performance information, the work performance data are compared with the 
project management plan components, project documents, and other project variables. This 
comparison helps to indicate how the project is performing.

243
Inputs and Outputs
Specific work performance metrics for scope, schedule, budget, and quality are defined at the start 
of the project as part of the project management plan. Performance data are collected during the 
project and compared to the plan and other variables to provide a context for work performance.
For example, work performance data on cost may include funds that have been expended. However, 
to be useful, that data should be compared to the budget, the work that was performed, the resources 
used to accomplish the work, and the funding schedule. This additional information provides the 
context to determine if the project is on budget or if there is a variance. It also indicates the degree of 
variance from the plan, and by comparing it to the variance thresholds in the project management plan 
it can indicate if preventive or corrective action is required. Interpreting work performance data and the 
additional information provides a sound foundation for making project decisions.
Work performance reports. The physical or electronic representation of work performance information 
compiled in project documents, which is intended to generate decisions, actions, or awareness. They 
are circulated to project stakeholders through the communication processes as defined in the project 
communications management plan.
Examples of work performance reports include status reports and progress reports. Work performance 
reports may contain earned value graphs and information, trend lines and forecasts, reserve burndown 
charts, defect histograms, contract performance information, and risk summaries. They can be 
presented as dashboards, heat reports, stoplight charts, or other representations useful for creating 
awareness and generating decisions and actions.

Tools and Techniques
All of the tools and techniques in this section appear in alphabetical order; therefore, no sections 
numbers are assigned.
Active listening. Techniques that involve acknowledging, clarifying and confirming, understanding, 
and removing barriers that adversely affect comprehension. Active listening is used to reduce 
misunderstandings and other miscommunications.
Advertising. Communications with users or potential users of a product, service, or result. Existing 
lists of potential sellers often can be expanded by placing advertisements in general circulation 
publications such as selected newspapers or in specialty trade publications. Most government 
jurisdictions require public advertising or online posting of pending government contracts.
Affinity diagrams. A technique that allows large numbers of ideas to be classified into groups for 
review and analysis. Affinity diagrams can also organize potential causes of defects into groups 
showing the areas that should be focused on the most.
Agile release planning. Agile release planning provides a high-level summary time line of the  
release schedule (typically 3 to 6 months) based on the product roadmap and the product vision for 
the product’s evolution. Agile release planning determines the number of iterations or sprints in  
the release. It also allows the product owner and team to decide how much needs to be developed 
and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals, dependencies,  
and impediments.
Since features represent value to the customer, the time line provides a more easily understood 
project schedule as it defines which features will be available at the end of each iteration, which is 
exactly the depth of information the customer is looking for.
Figure 10-1 shows the relationship among product vision, product roadmap, release planning, and 
iteration planning.

Alternatives analysis. Used to evaluate identified options in order to select the options or 
approaches to use to execute and perform project work. Alternatives analysis assists in providing the 
best solution to perform project activities, within the defined constraints.
Analogous estimating. Analogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of 
an activity or a project using historical data from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating 
uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as duration, budget, size, weight, and 
complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future project. When 
estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as 
the basis for estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, 
sometimes adjusted for known differences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating 
is frequently used to estimate project duration when there is a limited amount of detailed 
information about the project.

Tools and Techniques
Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other techniques, but  
it is also less accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments 
of a project and may be used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating 
is most reliable when the previous activities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the 
project team members preparing the estimates have the needed expertise.
Assessment of other risk parameters. A project team may consider other characteristics of risk (in 
addition to probability and impact) when prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis and 
action. These characteristics may include but are not limited to:
▶	 Urgency. The period of time within which a response to the risk is to be implemented in 
order to be effective. A short period indicates high urgency.
▶	 Proximity. The period of time before the risk might have an impact on one or more project 
objectives. A short period indicates high proximity.
▶	 Dormancy. The period of time that may elapse after a risk has occurred before its impact 
is discovered. A short period indicates low dormancy.
▶	 Manageability. The ease with which the risk owner (or owning organization) can manage 
the occurrence or impact of a risk. Where management is easy, manageability is high.
▶	 Controllability. The degree to which the risk owner (or owning organization) is able to control 
the risk’s outcome. Where the outcome can be easily controlled, controllability is high.
▶	 Detectability. The ease with which the results of the risk occurring, or being about to 
occur, can be detected and recognized. Where the risk occurrence can be detected easily, 
detectability is high.
▶	 Connectivity. The extent to which the risk is related to other individual project risks. Where 
a risk is connected to many other risks, connectivity is high.
▶	 Strategic impact. The potential for the risk to have a positive or negative effect on the 
organization’s strategic goals. Where the risk has a major effect on strategic goals, strategic 
impact is high.
▶	 Propinquity. The degree to which a risk is perceived to matter by one or more stakeholders. 
Where a risk is perceived as very significant, propinquity is high.
The consideration of some of these characteristics can provide a more robust prioritization of risks 
than is possible by only assessing probability and impact.

Assumption and constraint analysis. Every project and its project management plan are conceived 
and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints. These are often 
already incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. Assumption and constraint 
analysis explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the 
project. Threats may be identified from the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness 
of assumptions. Constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting 
factor that affects the execution of a project or process.
Audits. An audit is a structured, independent process used to determine if project activities comply 
with organizational and project policies, processes, and procedures.
▶	 Procurement audits. Audits are a structured review of the procurement process, which 
includes the review of contracts and contracting processes for completeness, accuracy, 
and effectiveness. Rights and obligations related to audits should be described in the 
procurement contract. Resulting audit observations should be brought to the attention of 
the buyer’s project manager and the seller’s project manager for adjustments to the project, 
when necessary.
▶	 Quality audits. A quality audit is usually conducted by a team external to the project, 
such as the organization’s internal audit department, project management office (PMO), 
or by an auditor external to the organization. Quality audit objectives may include but are 
not limited to:
▹	
Identifying all good and best practices being implemented;
▹	
Identifying all nonconformities, gaps, and shortcomings;
▹	
Sharing good practices introduced or implemented in similar projects in the 
organization and/or industry;
▹	
Proactively offering assistance in a positive manner to improve the implementation 
of processes to help raise team productivity;
▹	
Highlighting contributions of each audit in the lessons learned repository of the 
organization;
▹	
Subsequent efforts to correct any deficiencies should result in a reduced cost of quality 
and an increase in sponsor or customer acceptance of the project’s product.
▹	
Quality audits may be scheduled or random, and may be conducted by internal  
or external auditors; and
▹	
Quality audits can confirm the implementation of approved change requests including 
updates, corrective actions, defect repairs, and preventive actions.

Tools and Techniques
▶	 Risk audits. Risk audits are a type of audit that may be used to consider the effectiveness 
of the risk management process. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that 
risk audits are performed at an appropriate frequency, as defined in the project’s risk 
management plan. Risk audits may be included during routine project review meetings or 
may form part of a risk review meeting, or the team may choose to hold separate risk audit 
meetings. The format for the risk audit and its objectives should be clearly defined before 
the audit is conducted.
Autocratic decision making. In this decision-making technique, one individual takes responsibility 
for making the decision for the entire group.
Benchmarking. Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned project practices or the 
project’s quality standards to those of comparable projects to identify best practices, generate 
ideas for improvement, and provide a basis for measuring performance. Benchmarked projects 
may exist within the performing organization or outside of it; or can be within the same application 
area or other application area. Benchmarking allows analogies to be made for projects in different 
application areas or different industries.
Bidder conferences. Bidder conferences (also called contractor conferences, vendor conferences, 
and pre-bid conferences) are meetings between the buyer and prospective sellers prior to 
proposal submittal. They are used to ensure that all prospective bidders have a clear and common 
understanding of the procurement and no bidders receive preferential treatment.
Bottom-up estimating. Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost 
by aggregating the estimates of the lower-level components of the work breakdown structure 
(WBS). When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence, the 
work within the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These 
estimates are then aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations. Activities may 
or may not have dependencies between them that can affect the application and use of resources. 
If there are dependencies, this pattern of resource usage is reflected and documented in the 
estimated requirements of the activity.
Brainstorming. This technique is used to identify a list of ideas in a short period of time. It is conducted 
in a group environment and is led by a facilitator. Brainstorming comprises two parts: idea generation 
and analysis. Brainstorming can be used to gather data and solutions or ideas from stakeholders, 
subject matter experts, and team members.

Cause-and-effect diagrams. Cause-and-effect diagrams are also known as fishbone diagrams, why-
why diagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem 
statement identified into discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem. 
Figure 10-2 is an example of a cause-and-effect diagram.

Tools and Techniques
In order to facilitate configuration and change management, manual or automated tools may 
be used. Configuration control is focused on the specification of both the deliverables and the 
processes, while change control is focused on identifying, documenting, and approving or rejecting 
changes to the project documents, deliverables, or baselines. Tool selection should be based on 
the needs of the project stakeholders, including organizational and environmental considerations 
and/or constraints.
Checklists. A checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. It is often used as a 
reminder. Checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been 
accumulated from similar projects and from other sources of information. They are an effective 
way to capture lessons learned from similar completed projects, listing specific individual project 
risks that have occurred previously and that may be relevant to this project. The organization may 
maintain checklists based on its own completed projects or may use generic checklists from the 
industry. While a checklist may be quick and simple to use, it is impossible to build an exhaustive 
one. The project team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. Additionally, 
the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as remove 
or archive obsolete information.
Check sheets. Check sheets are also known as tally sheets. They are used to organize facts in a way 
that facilitates the effective collection of useful data about a potential quality problem. They are 
especially useful for gathering attributes data while performing inspections to identify defects; for 
example, data about the frequencies or consequences of defects collected. See Figure 10-3.

Claims administration. Claims administration is the process of processing, adjudicating, and 
communicating contract claims. Contested changes and potential constructive changes are those 
requested changes where the buyer and seller cannot reach an agreement on compensation for 
the change or cannot agree that a change has occurred. These contested changes are called claims. 
When they cannot be resolved, they become disputes and, finally, appeals. Claims are documented, 
processed, monitored, and managed throughout the contract life cycle, usually in accordance with 
the terms of the contract. If the parties themselves do not resolve a claim, it may have to be handled 
in accordance with alternative dispute resolution (ADR) typically following procedures established in 
the contract. Settlement of all claims and disputes through negotiation is the preferred method.
Colocation. An organizational placement strategy where the project team members are  
physically located close to one another in order to improve communication, working relationships, 
and productivity.
Colocation involves placing many or all of the most active project team members in the same 
physical location to enhance their ability to perform as a team. Colocation can be temporary, 
such as at strategically important times during the project, or can continue for the entire project. 
Colocation strategies can include a team meeting room, common places to post schedules, and 
other conveniences that enhance communication and a sense of community.
Communication competence. A combination of tailored communication skills that considers 
factors such as clarity of purpose in key messages, effective relationships and information sharing, 
and leadership behaviors.
Communication methods. A systematic procedure, technique, or process used to transfer information 
among project stakeholders.
There are several communication methods that are used to share information among project 
stakeholders. These methods are broadly classified as follows:
▶	 Interactive communication. Interactive communication takes place between two or 
more parties who are performing a multidirectional exchange of information in real time. 
It employs communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, 
some forms of social media, and videoconferencing.

--- SOURCE: processgroupspracticeguide_eng.pdf | PAGE 274 ---
253
Tools and Techniques
▶	 Push communication. Push communications are sent or distributed directly to specific 
recipients who need to receive the information. This ensures that the information is 
distributed but does not ensure that it reached or was understood by the intended audience. 
Push communication artifacts include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice mails, 
blogs, and press releases.
▶	 Pull communication. A pull communication is used for large complex information 
sets or for large audiences, and requires the recipients to access content at their own 
discretion subject to security procedures. These methods include web portals, intranet 
sites, eLearning, lessons learned databases, or knowledge repositories.
Different approaches should be applied to meet the needs of the major forms of communication 
defined in the communications management plan:
▶	 Interpersonal communication. Information that is exchanged between individuals, 
typically face to face.
▶	 Small group communication. Communications that occur within groups of three to  
six people.
▶	 Public communication. A public communication occurs when a single speaker is addressing 
a group of people.
▶	 Mass communication. Mass communication is an approach with a minimal connection 
between the person or group sending the message and the large, sometimes anonymous, 
groups for whom the information is intended.
▶	 Networks and social computing communication. This type of approach supports 
emerging communication trends of many-to-many supported by social computing 
technology and media.
Possible communications artifacts and methods include but are not limited to:
▶	 Notice boards,
▶	 Newsletters/in-house magazines/e-magazines,
▶	 Letters to staff/volunteers,
▶	 Press releases,
▶	 Annual reports,

▶	 Emails and intranets,
▶	 Web portals and other information repositories (for pull communication),
▶	 Phone conversations,
▶	 Presentations,
▶	 Team briefings/group meetings,
▶	 Focus groups,
▶	 Face-to-face formal or informal meetings between various stakeholders,
▶	 Consultation groups or staff forums, and
▶	 Social computing technology and media.
Communication models. A description, analogy, or schematic used to represent how the 
communication process will be performed for the project.
Communication models can represent the communication process in its most basic linear form 
(sender and receiver), in a more interactive form that encompasses the additional element of 
feedback (sender, receiver, and feedback), or in a more complex model that incorporates the 
human elements of the sender(s) or receiver(s) and attempts to show the complexity of any 
communication that involves people.
▶	 Sample basic sender/receiver communication model. This model describes communication 
as a process and consists of two parties, defined as the sender and receiver. This model 
is concerned with ensuring that the message is delivered rather than understood. The 
sequence of steps in a basic communication model is:
▹	
Encode. The message is coded into symbols, such as text, sound, or some other medium, 
for transmission (sending).
▹	
Transmit message. The message is sent via a communication channel. The transmission 
of this message may be compromised by various physical factors such as unfamiliar 
technology or inadequate infrastructure. Noise and other factors may be present and 
contribute to loss of information in transmission and/or reception of the message.
▹	
Decode. The data received is translated by the receiver back into a form useful to  
the receiver.

255
Tools and Techniques
▶	 Sample interactive communication model. This model also describes communication 
as a process consisting of two parties, the sender and receiver, but recognizes the need 
to ensure that the message has been understood. In this model, noise includes any 
interference or barriers that might compromise the understanding of the message, such 
as the distraction of the receiver, variations in the perceptions of receivers, or lack of 
appropriate knowledge or interest. The additional steps in an interactive communication 
model are:
▹	
Acknowledge. Upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal (acknowledge) receipt 
of the message, but this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension 
of the message—merely that it has been received.
▹	
Feedback/response. When the received message has been decoded and understood, 
the receiver encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this 
message to the original sender. If the sender perceives that the feedback matches the 
original message, the communication has been successful. In communication between 
people, feedback can be achieved through active listening.
As part of the communication process, the sender is responsible for the transmission of 
the message, ensuring the information being communicated is clear and complete, and 
confirming the message is correctly interpreted. The receiver is responsible for ensuring 
that the information is received in its entirety, interpreted correctly, and acknowledged or 
responded to appropriately. These components take place in an environment where there 
will likely be noise and other barriers to effective communication.
Cross-cultural communication presents challenges to ensuring that the meaning of the message 
has been understood. Differences in communication styles can arise from differences in working 
methods, age, nationality, professional discipline, ethnicity, race, or gender. People from different 
cultures communicate using different languages (e.g., technical design documents, different styles) 
and expect different processes and protocols.
The communication model shown in Figure 10-4 incorporates the idea that the message itself, and 
how it is transmitted, is influenced by the sender’s current emotional state, knowledge, background, 
personality, culture, and biases. Similarly, the receiver’s emotional state, knowledge, background, 
personality, culture, and biases will influence how the message is received and interpreted, and will 
contribute to the barriers or noise.

This communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies 
and plans for person-to-person or even small-group-to-small-group communications. It is not useful 
for other communications artifacts such as emails, broadcast messages, or social media.
Communication requirements analysis. An analytical technique to determine the information 
needs of the project stakeholders through interviews, workshops, study of lessons learned from 
previous projects, etc. Analysis of communication requirements determines the information needs 
of the project stakeholders. These requirements are defined by combining the type and format of 
information needed with an analysis of the value of that information.
Sources of information typically used to identify and define project communication requirements 
include but are not limited to:
▶	 Stakeholder information and communication requirements from within the stakeholder 
register and stakeholder engagement plan;
▶	 Number of potential communication channels or paths, including one-to-one, one-to-many, 
and many-to-many communications;

▶	 Organizational charts;
▶	 Project organization and stakeholder responsibilities, relationships, and interdependencies;
▶	 Development approach;
▶	 Disciplines, departments, and specialties involved in the project;
▶	 Logistics of how many persons will be involved with the project and at which locations;
▶	 Internal information needs (e.g., when communicating within organizations);
▶	 External information needs (e.g., when communicating with the media, public,  
or contractors); and
▶	 Legal requirements.
Communication styles assessment. A technique used to assess communication styles and 
identify the preferred communication method, format, and content for planned communication 
activities. Often used with unsupportive stakeholders, this assessment may follow a stakeholder 
engagement assessment to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that require additional 
tailored communication activities and artifacts.
Communication technology. Specific tools, systems, computer programs, etc., used to transfer 
information among project stakeholders.
The methods used to transfer information among project stakeholders may vary significantly. Common 
methods used for information exchange and collaboration include conversations, meetings, written 
documents, databases, social media, and websites.
Factors that can affect the choice of communication technology include:
▶	 Urgency of the need for information. The urgency, frequency, and format of the 
information to be communicated may vary from project to project and within different 
phases of a project.
▶	 Availability and reliability of technology. The technology that is required for distribution 
of project communications artifacts should be compatible, available, and accessible for all 
stakeholders throughout the project.
▶	 Ease of use. The choice of communication technologies should be suitable for project 
participants and proper training events should be planned, where appropriate.

▶	 Project environment. Factors to consider are:
▹	
Will the team meet and operate on a face-to-face basis or in a virtual environment?
▹	
Will the team be located in one or multiple time zones?
▹	
Will the team use multiple languages for communication?
▹	
Are there any other project environmental factors, such as various aspects of culture, 
which may constrain the efficiency of the communication?
▶	 Sensitivity and confidentiality of the information. Some aspects to consider are:
▹	
Will the information to be communicated be sensitive or confidential? If so, additional 
security measures may be required.
▹	
Does the organization have social media policies for employees to ensure appropriate 
behavior, security, and the protection of proprietary information?
Conflict management. Conflict is inevitable in a project environment. Sources of conflict include 
scarce resources, scheduling priorities, and personal work styles. Team ground rules, group norms, 
and solid project management practices, such as communication planning and role definition, 
reduce the amount of conflict.
Successful conflict management results in greater productivity and positive working relationships. 
When managed properly, differences of opinion can lead to increased creativity and better decision 
making. If the differences become a negative factor, project team members are initially responsible for 
their resolution. If conflict escalates, the project manager should help facilitate a satisfactory resolution. 
Conflict should be addressed early and usually in private, using a direct, collaborative approach.  
If disruptive conflict continues, formal procedures may be used, including disciplinary actions.
The success of project managers in managing their project teams often depends on their ability to 
resolve conflict. Different project managers may use different conflict resolution methods. Factors 
that influence conflict resolution methods include:
▶	 Importance and intensity of the conflict,
▶	 Time pressure for resolving the conflict,
▶	 Relative power of the people involved in the conflict,
▶	 Importance of maintaining a good relationship, and
▶	 Motivation to resolve conflict on a long-term or short-term basis.

Tools and Techniques
There are five general techniques for resolving conflict. Each technique has its place and use:
▶	 Withdraw/avoid. Retreating from an actual or potential conflict situation; postponing the 
issue to be better prepared or to be resolved by others.
▶	 Smooth/accommodate. Emphasizing areas of agreement rather than areas of difference; 
conceding one’s position to the needs of others to maintain harmony and relationships.
▶	 Compromise/reconcile. Searching for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to 
all parties in order to temporarily or partially resolve the conflict. This approach occasionally 
results in a lose-lose situation.
▶	 Force/direct. Pushing one’s viewpoint at the expense of others; offering only win-lose 
solutions, usually enforced through a power position to resolve an emergency. This 
approach often results in a win-lose situation.
▶	 Collaborate/problem solve. Incorporating multiple viewpoints and insights from differing 
perspectives; requires a cooperative attitude and open dialogue that typically leads to 
consensus and commitment. This approach can result in a win-win situation.
Context diagram. A visual depiction of the product scope showing a business system (process, 
equipment, computer system, etc.), and how people and other systems (actors) interact with it.  
The context diagram is an example of a scope model. Context diagrams show inputs to the business 
system, the actor(s) providing the input, the outputs from the business system, and the actor(s) 
receiving the output.
Contingent response strategies. There are five alternative strategies that may be considered for 
dealing with opportunities, as follows:
▶	 Escalate. This risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project 
sponsor agrees that an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed 
response would exceed the project manager’s authority. Escalated opportunities are 
managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, 
but not on the project level. The project manager determines who should be notified about 
the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. 
It is important that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party 
in the organization. Opportunities are usually escalated to the level that matches the 
objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred. Escalated opportunities are 
not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although they may be recorded 
in the risk register for information.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
▶	 Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the 
organization wants to ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to 
capture the benefit associated with a particular opportunity by ensuring that it definitely 
happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. Examples of exploiting 
responses may include assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project 
to reduce the time to completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to 
reduce cost and duration.
▶	 Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that 
it shares some of the benefit if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new 
owner of a shared opportunity carefully, so they are best able to capture the opportunity 
for the benefit of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a risk premium to the 
party taking on the opportunity. Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing 
partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures.
▶	 Enhance. The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or impact of an 
opportunity. Early enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the 
benefit after the opportunity has occurred. The probability of occurrence of an opportunity 
may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it is not possible to increase 
probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors that 
drive the size of the potential benefit. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding 
more resources to an activity to finish early.
▶	 Accept. Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is 
taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be 
adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address an opportunity in any other 
way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance 
strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or 
resources to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves 
no proactive action apart from periodic review of the opportunity to ensure that it does 
not change significantly.

Tools and Techniques
Control charts. Control charts are used to determine whether or not a process is stable or has 
predictable performance. Upper and lower specification limits are based on the requirements and 
reflect the maximum and minimum values allowed. Upper and lower control limits are different 
from specification limits. The control limits are determined using standard statistical calculations 
and principles to ultimately establish the natural capability for a stable process. The project manager 
and appropriate stakeholders may use the statistically calculated control limits to identify the points 
at which corrective action will be taken to prevent performance that remains outside the control 
limits. Control charts can be used to monitor various types of output variables. Although used most 
frequently to track repetitive activities required for producing manufactured lots, control charts may 
also be used to monitor cost and schedule variances, volume, frequency of scope changes, or other 
management results to help determine if the project management processes are in control.
Cost aggregation. Cost estimates are aggregated by work packages in accordance with the work 
breakdown structure (WBS). The work package cost estimates are then aggregated for the higher 
component levels of the WBS (such as control accounts) and, ultimately, for the entire project.
Cost-benefit analysis. A financial analysis tool used to determine the benefits provided by a project 
against its costs. A cost-benefit analysis is used to estimate the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives 
in order to determine the best alternative in terms of benefits provided. A cost-benefit analysis will help 
the project manager determine if project activities are cost effective. A cost-benefit analysis compares 
the cost of an activity to the expected benefit.
Cost of quality. The cost of quality (COQ) associated with a project consists of one or more of the 
following costs (Figure 10-5 lists examples for each cost group):
▶	 Prevention costs. Costs related to the prevention of poor quality in products, deliverables, 
or services of the specific project.
▶	 Appraisal costs. Costs related to evaluating, measuring, auditing, and testing products, 
deliverables, or services of a specific project.
▶	 Failure costs (internal/external). Costs related to nonconformance of products, deliverables, 
or services based on the needs or expectations of the stakeholders.
The optimal COQ is one that reflects the appropriate balance for investing in the cost of prevention 
and appraisal to avoid failure costs. Models show that there is an optimal quality cost for projects, 
where investing in additional prevention/appraisal costs is neither beneficial nor cost effective.

Critical path method. The critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration 
and determine the amount of schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule 
model. This schedule network analysis technique calculates the early start, early finish, late start, 
and late finish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations by performing a 
forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network, as shown in Figure 10-6. In this 
example, the longest path includes activities A, C, and D, and therefore, the sequence of A-C-D is the 
critical path. The critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through 
a project, which determines the shortest possible project duration. The longest path has the least 
total float—usually zero. The resulting early and late start and finish dates are not necessarily the 
project schedule; rather they indicate the time periods within which the activity could be executed, 
using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logical relationships, 
leads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the critical 
path(s) and the amount of total and free float or schedule flexibility on the logical network paths 
within the schedule model.

Tools and Techniques
On any network path, the total float or schedule flexibility is measured by the amount of time that 
a schedule activity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project 
finish date or violating a schedule constraint. A critical path is normally characterized by zero total 
float on the critical path. As implemented with the precedence diagramming method sequencing, 
critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total float depending on the constraints applied. 
Positive total float is caused when the backward pass is calculated from a schedule constraint that 
is later than the early finish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation. Negative 
total float is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Negative 
float analysis is a technique that helps to find possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed 
schedule back on track. Schedule networks may have multiple near-critical paths. Many software 
packages allow the user to define the parameters used to determine the critical path(s). Adjustments 
to activity durations (when more resources or less scope can be arranged), logical relationships (when 
the relationships were discretionary to begin with), leads and lags, or other schedule constraints may 
be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total float. Once the total float and the 
free float have been calculated, the free float is the amount of time that a schedule activity can be 
delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. For 
example, the free float for Activity B, in Figure 10-6, is 5 days.

Cultural awareness. Cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals, 
groups, and organizations and adapting the project’s communication strategy in the context of these 
differences. This awareness and any consequent actions minimize misunderstandings and miscom-
munication that may result from cultural differences within the project’s stakeholder community. 
Cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity help the project manager to plan communications based 
on the cultural differences and requirements of stakeholders and team members.
Decision making. Decision-making techniques include but are not limited to:
▶	 Voting. Voting is a collective decision-making technique and an assessment process 
having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in the form of future actions. 
These techniques can be used to generate, classify, and prioritize product requirements. 
Examples of voting techniques include:
▹	
Unanimity. A decision that is reached whereby everyone agrees on a single course  
of action.
▹	
Majority. A decision that is reached with support obtained from more than 50% of the 
members of the group. Having a group size with an uneven number of participants can 
ensure that a decision will be reached rather than resulting in a tie.
▹	
Plurality. A decision that is reached whereby the largest block in a group decides, even  
if a majority is not achieved. This method is generally used when the number of options 
nominated is more than two.
▶	 Autocratic decision making. In this method, one individual takes responsibility for making 
the decision for the group.
▶	 Multicriteria decision analysis. A technique that uses a decision matrix to provide  
a systematic analytical approach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, uncertainty, 
and valuation, to evaluate and rank many ideas.
Decision Tree Analysis. Decision tree analysis is a diagramming and calculation technique for 
evaluating the implications of a chain of multiple options in the presence of uncertainty. Decision 
trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of action. Alternative 
paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different 
decisions or events, each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks 
(including both threats and opportunities). The end points of branches in the decision tree represent 
the outcome from following that particular path, which can be negative or positive.

Note 1: The decision tree shows how to make a decision between alternative capital strategies (represented as “decision  
 
nodes”) when the environment contains uncertain elements (represented as “chance nodes”).
Note 2: Here, a decision is being made whether to invest $120M US to build a new plant or to instead invest only $50M US
 
to upgrade the existing plant. For each decision, the demand (which is uncertain, and therefore represents a
 
“chance node”) must be accounted for. For example, strong demand leads to $200M revenue with the new plant
 
but only $120M US for the upgraded plant, perhaps due to capacity limitations of the upgraded plant. The end of
 
each branch shows the net effect of the payoffs minus costs. For each decision branch, all effects are added (see
 
shaded areas) to determine the overall Expected Monetary Value (EMV) of the decision. Remember to account for
 
the investment costs. From the calculations in the shaded areas, the upgraded plant has a higher EMV of $46M – 
 
also the EMV of the overall decision. (This choice also represents the lowest risk, avoiding the worst case possible  
 
outcome of a loss of $30M).

Decomposition. A technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and project 
deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. The work package is the work defined at the 
lowest level of the work breakdown structure (WBS) for which cost and duration can be estimated 
and managed. The level of decomposition is often guided by the degree of control needed to 
effectively manage the project. The level of detail for work packages varies depending on the size 
and complexity of the project. Decomposition of the total project work into work packages generally 
involves the following activities:
▶	 Identifying and analyzing the deliverables and related work,
▶	 Structuring and organizing the WBS,
▶	 Decomposing the upper WBS levels into lower-level detailed components,
▶	 Developing and assigning identification codes to the WBS components, and
▶	 Verifying that the degree of decomposition of the deliverables is appropriate.
A portion of a WBS with some branches of the WBS decomposed down through the work package 
level is shown in Figure 10-8.

Tools and Techniques
A WBS structure may be created through various approaches. Some of the popular methods include 
the top-down approach, the use of organization-specific guidelines, and the use of WBS templates.  
A bottom-up approach can be used to group subcomponents. The WBS structure can be represented 
in various forms, such as:
▶	 Using phases of the project life cycle as the second level of decomposition, with the product 
and project deliverables inserted at the third level, as shown in Figure 10-9;
▶	 Using major deliverables as the second level of decomposition, as shown in Figure 10-10; and
▶	 Incorporating subcomponents that may be developed by organizations outside the project 
team, such as contracted work. The seller then develops the supporting contract WBS as 
part of the contracted work.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Decomposition of the upper-level WBS components requires subdividing the work for each of 
the deliverables or subcomponents into its most fundamental components, where the WBS 
components represent verifiable products, services, or results. If an agile approach is used, epics 
can be decomposed into user stories. The WBS may be structured as an outline, an organizational 
chart, or other method that identifies a hierarchical breakdown. Verifying the correctness of the 
decomposition requires determining that the lower-level WBS components are those that are 
necessary and sufficient for completion of the corresponding higher-level deliverables. Different 
deliverables can have different levels of decomposition. To arrive at a work package, the work for 
some deliverables needs to be decomposed only to the next level, while others need additional levels 
of decomposition. As the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail, the ability to plan, manage, 
and control the work is enhanced. However, excessive decomposition can lead to nonproductive 
management effort, inefficient use of resources, decreased efficiency in performing the work, and 
difficulty aggregating data over different levels of the WBS.

Tools and Techniques
Decomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far 
into the future. The project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent 
is agreed on, so the details of the WBS can be developed. This technique is sometimes referred to as 
rolling wave planning.
The WBS represents all product and project work, including the project management work. The total 
of the work at the lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no 
extra work is performed. This is sometimes called the 100 percent rule.
For specific information regarding the WBS, refer to the Practice Standard for Work Breakdown 
Structures – Second Edition [10]. This standard contains industry-specific examples of WBS templates 
that can be tailored to specific projects in a particular application area.
Dependency determination and integration. Dependencies may be characterized by the following 
attributes: mandatory or discretionary, internal or external (as described below). Dependency has 
four attributes, but two can be applicable at the same time in the following ways: mandatory external 
dependencies, mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, or discretionary 
internal dependencies.
▶	 Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or 
contractually required or inherent in the nature of the work. Mandatory dependencies 
often involve physical limitations, such as on a construction project, where it is impossible 
to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built, or on an electronics 
project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependencies 
are sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies 
may not be mandatory. The project team determines which dependencies are mandatory 
during the process of sequencing the activities. Mandatory dependencies should not be 
confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool.
▶	 Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as 
preferred logic, preferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established 
based on knowledge of best practices within a particular application area or some unusual 
aspect of the project where a specific sequence is desired, even though there may be other 
acceptable sequences. For example, generally accepted best practices recommend that 
during construction, the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbing work. 
This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel); 
however, performing the activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Discretionary dependencies should be fully documented since they can create arbitrary 
total float values and can limit later scheduling options. When fast-tracking techniques 
are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered 
for modification or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are 
discretionary during the process of sequencing the activities.
▶	 External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project 
activities and non-project activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project 
team’s control. For example, the testing activity in a software project may be dependent 
on the delivery of hardware from an external source, or governmental environmental 
hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction project. 
The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the 
process of sequencing the activities.
▶	 Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between 
project activities and are generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if the team 
cannot test a machine until they assemble it, there is an internal mandatory dependency. 
The project management team determines which dependencies are internal during the 
process of sequencing the activities
Design for X. Design for X (DfX) is a set of technical guidelines that may be applied during the design 
of a product for the optimization of a specific aspect of the design. DfX can control or even improve the 
product’s final characteristics. The X in DfX can be different aspects of product development, such as 
reliability, deployment, assembly, manufacturing, cost, service, usability, safety, and quality. Using the 
DfX may result in cost reduction, quality improvement, better performance, and customer satisfaction.
Document analysis. Document analysis consists of reviewing and assessing any relevant 
documented information. There is a wide range of documents that may be analyzed. Examples of 
documents that may be analyzed include but are not limited to:
▶	 Agreements and contracts;
▶	 Business plans, processes, or interface documentation;
▶	 Business rules repositories;
▶	 Current process flows;
▶	 Marketing literature;
▶	 Plans, assumptions, constraints, historical files, and technical documentation;

▶	 Problem/issue logs;
▶	 Policies and procedures;
▶	 Quality reports, test reports, performance reports, and variance analysis;
▶	 Regulatory documentation such as laws, codes, or ordinances, etc.;
▶	 Requests for proposal; and
▶	 Use cases.
Earned value analysis. Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to 
the actual schedule and cost performance. EVM integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline 
and schedule baseline to form the performance measurement baseline. EVM develops and monitors 
three key dimensions for each work package and control account:
▶	 Planned value. Planned value (PV) is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. 
It is the authorized budget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work 
breakdown structure (WBS) component, not including management reserve. This budget 
is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a given point in time, PV defines 
the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of the PV is sometimes 
referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total PV for the project 
is also known as budget at completion (BAC).
▶	 Earned value. Earned value (EV) is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of 
the budget authorized for that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work 
that has been completed. The EV being measured needs to be related to the PMB, and 
the EV measured cannot be greater than the authorized PV budget for a component. The 
EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progress measurement 
criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. 
Project managers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and 
cumulatively to determine the long-term performance trends.
▶	 Actual cost. Actual cost (AC) is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an 
activity during a specific time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work 
that the EV measured. The AC needs to correspond in definition to what was budgeted 
in the PV and measured in the EV (e.g., direct hours only, direct costs only, or all costs 
including indirect costs). The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spent to achieve the 
EV will be measured.

Emotional intelligence (EI). The ability to identify, assess, and manage the personal emotions of 
oneself and other people, as well as the collective emotions of groups of people. A project team can 
use emotional intelligence to reduce tension and increase cooperation by identifying, assessing, and 
controlling the sentiments of project team members, anticipating their actions, acknowledging their 
concerns, and following up on their issues.
A project manager should invest in personal EI by improving inbound (e.g., self-management and 
self-awareness) and outbound (e.g., relationship management) competencies. Research suggests that 
project teams that succeed in developing team EI or become an emotionally competent group are 
more effective. Additionally, there is a reduction in staff turnover.
Expert judgment. Judgment provided based upon expertise in an application area, discipline, 
industry, etc., as appropriate for the activity being performed. Such expertise may be provided by 
any group or person with specialized education, knowledge, skill, experience, or training.
Facilitation. Facilitation is the ability to effectively guide a group event to a successful decision, 
solution, or conclusion. A facilitator ensures the following:
▶	 There is effective participation.
▶	 Participants achieve a mutual understanding.
▶	 All contributions are considered.
▶	 Conclusions or results have full buy-in according to the decision process established  
for the project.
▶	 Actions and agreements that are achieved are appropriately dealt with afterward.
Feedback. Feedback is information about reactions to communications, a deliverable, or a situation. 
Feedback supports interactive communication between the project manager, project team, and all 
other project stakeholders. Examples include coaching, mentoring, and negotiating.
Financing. Financing entails acquiring funding for projects. It is common for long-term infrastructure, 
industrial, and public services projects to seek external sources of funds. If a project is funded 
externally, the funding entity may have certain requirements that are required to be met.

Tools and Techniques
Flowcharts. Flowcharts are also referred to as process maps because they display the sequence of 
steps and the branching possibilities that exist for a process that transforms one or more inputs into 
one or more outputs. Flowcharts show the activities, decision points, branching loops, parallel paths, 
and the overall order of processing by mapping the operational details of procedures that exist 
within a horizontal value chain. One version of a value chain, known as a SIPOC (suppliers, inputs, 
process, outputs, and customers) model, is shown in Figure 10-11. Flowcharts may prove useful in 
understanding and estimating the cost of quality for a process. Information is obtained by using the 
workflow branching logic and associated relative frequencies to estimate the expected monetary 
value for the conformance and nonconformance work required to deliver the expected conforming 
output. When flowcharts are used to represent the steps in a process, they are sometimes called 
process flows or process flow diagrams and they can be used for process improvement as well as 
identifying where quality defects can occur or where to incorporate quality checks.

Focus groups. An elicitation technique that brings together prequalified stakeholders and subject 
matter experts to learn about their expectations and attitudes about a proposed product, service, or 
result. A trained moderator guides the group through an interactive discussion designed to be more 
conversational than a one-on-one interview.
Funding limit reconciliation. The process of reconciling the expenditure of funds with any 
funding limits on the commitment of funds for the project. A variance between the funding limits 
and the planned expenditures will sometimes necessitate the rescheduling of work to level out the 
rate of expenditures. This is accomplished by placing imposed date constraints for work into the 
project schedule.
Ground rules. Defined in the team charter, ground rules set the expected behavior for project team 
members and other stakeholders with regard to stakeholder engagement.
Hierarchical charts. The traditional organizational chart structure can be used to show positions 
and relationships in a graphical, top-down format.
▶	 Work breakdown structures (WBS). The WBS is designed to show how project 
deliverables are broken down into work packages and provide a way of showing high-
level areas of responsibility.
▶	 Organizational breakdown structure (OBS). While the WBS shows a breakdown of project 
deliverables, an OBS is arranged according to an organization’s existing departments, units, 
or teams, with the project activities or work packages listed under each department. An 
operational department, such as information technology or purchasing, can see all of its 
project responsibilities by looking at its portion of the OBS.
▶	 Resource breakdown structure. The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical 
list of team and physical resources related by category and resource type that is used 
for planning, managing, and controlling project work. Each descending (lower) level 
represents an increasingly detailed description of the resource until the information is 
small enough to be used in conjunction with the WBS to allow the work to be planned, 
monitored, and controlled.
Histograms. Histograms show a graphical representation of numerical data. Histograms can show 
the number of defects per deliverable, a ranking of the cause of defects, the number of times each 
process is noncompliant, or other representations of project or product defects.

Tools and Techniques
Historical information review. Reviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric 
estimates or analogous estimates. Historical information may include project characteristics 
(parameters) to develop mathematical models to predict total project costs. Such models may be 
simple (e.g., residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space) 
or complex (e.g., one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment 
factors, each of which has numerous points within it).
Both the cost and accuracy of analogous and parametric models can vary widely. They are most likely 
to be reliable when:
▶	 Historical information used to develop the model is accurate,
▶	 Parameters used in the model are readily quantifiable, and
▶	 Models are scalable, such that they work for large projects, small projects,  
and phases of a project.
Individual and team assessments. Individual and team assessment tools give the project 
manager and the project team insight into areas of strengths and weaknesses. These tools help 
project managers assess team members’ preferences, aspirations, how they process and organize 
information, how they make decisions, and how they interact with people. Various tools are available 
such as attitudinal surveys, specific assessments, structured interviews, ability tests, and focus 
groups. These tools can provide improved understanding, trust, commitment, and communications 
among team members and facilitate more productive teams throughout the project.
Influence diagrams. Influence diagrams are graphical aids to decision making under uncertainty. 
An influence diagram represents a project or situation within the project as a set of entities, 
outcomes, and influences, together with the relationships and effects between them. Where an 
element in the influence diagram is uncertain as a result of the existence of individual project 
risks or other sources of uncertainty, this can be represented in the influence diagram using 
ranges or probability distributions. The influence diagram is then evaluated using a simulation 
technique, such as Monte Carlo analysis, to indicate which elements have the greatest influence 
on key outcomes. Outputs from an influence diagram are similar to other quantitative risk analysis 
methods, including S-curves and tornado diagrams.

Influencing. Because project managers often have little or no direct authority over team members 
in a matrix environment, their ability to influence stakeholders on a timely basis is critical to project 
success. Key influencing skills include:
▶	 Ability to be persuasive,
▶	 Clearly articulating points and positions,
▶	 High levels of active and effective listening skills,
▶	 Awareness of, and consideration for, the various perspectives in any situation, and
▶	 Gathering relevant information to address issues and reach agreements while 
maintaining mutual trust.
Information management. Information management tools and techniques are used to create and 
connect people to information. They are effective for sharing simple, unambiguous, codified explicit 
knowledge. They include but are not limited to:
▶	 Methods for codifying explicit knowledge; for example, for producing lessons learned 
entries for the lessons learned register;
▶	 Lessons learned register;
▶	 Library services;
▶	 Information gathering, for example, web searches and reading published articles; and
▶	 Project management information system (PMIS). Project management information 
systems often include document management systems.
Tools and techniques that connect people to information can be enhanced by adding an element 
of interaction, for example, include a “contact me” function so users can get in touch with the 
originators of the lessons and ask for advice specific to their project and context.
Knowledge and information management tools and techniques should be connected to project 
processes and process owners. Communities of practice and subject matter experts (SMEs), for 
example, may generate insights that lead to improved control processes. Having an internal sponsor 
can ensure improvements are implemented. Lessons learned register entries may be analyzed to 
identify common issues that can be addressed by changes to project procedures.

Inspection. An inspection is the examination of a work product to determine if it conforms to documented 
standards. The results of inspections generally include measurements and may be conducted at any 
level. The results of a single activity can be inspected, or the final product of the project can be inspected. 
Inspections may be called reviews, peer reviews, audits, or walkthroughs. In some application areas, these 
terms have narrow and specific meanings. Inspections also are used to verify defect repairs.
Interviews. A formal or informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders by talking to 
them directly. It is typically performed by asking prepared and spontaneous questions and recording 
the responses. Interviews are often conducted on an individual basis between an interviewer and 
an interviewee but may involve multiple interviewers and/or multiple interviewees. Interviewing 
experienced project participants, sponsors, other executives, and subject matter experts can aid in 
identifying and defining the features and functions of the desired product deliverables. Interviews 
are also useful for obtaining confidential information.
Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration 
backlog. It is used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work 
committed from iteration planning. A forecast trend line can be used to predict the likely variance 
at iteration completion and take appropriate actions during the course of the iteration. A diagonal 
line representing the ideal burndown and daily actual remaining work is then plotted. A trend line is 
then calculated to forecast completion based on remaining work. Figure 10-12 is an example of an 
iteration burndown chart.

Knowledge management. Knowledge management tools and techniques connect people so they 
can work together to create new knowledge, share tacit knowledge, and integrate the knowledge 
of diverse team members. The tools and techniques appropriate in a project depend on the nature 
of the project, especially the degree of innovation involved, the project complexity, and the level of 
diversity (including diversity of disciplines) among team members.
Tools and techniques include but are not limited to:
▶	 Networking, including informal social interaction and online social networking. Online 
forums where people can ask open questions (“What does anyone know about…?”) are 
useful for starting knowledge-sharing conversations with specialists;
▶	 Communities of practice (sometimes called communities of interest or just communities) 
and special interest groups;
▶	 Meetings, including virtual meetings where participants can interact using  
communications technology;
▶	 Work shadowing and reverse shadowing;
▶	 Discussion forums such as focus groups;
▶	 Knowledge-sharing events such as seminars and conferences;
▶	 Workshops, including problem-solving sessions and learning reviews designed to identify 
lessons learned;
▶	 Storytelling;
▶	 Creativity and ideas management techniques;
▶	 Knowledge fairs and cafés; and
▶	 Training that involves interaction between learners.
All of these tools and techniques can be applied face to face or virtually, or both. Face-to-face 
interaction is usually the most effective way to build the trusting relationships that are needed to 
manage knowledge. Once relationships are established, virtual interaction can be used to maintain 
the relationship.

Tools and Techniques
Leadership. The knowledge, skills, and behaviors needed to guide, motivate, and direct a team to help 
an organization achieve its business goals. These skills may include demonstrating essential capabilities 
such as negotiation, resilience, communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and interpersonal 
skills. Projects are becoming increasingly more complicated with more and more businesses executing 
their strategy through projects. Project management is more than just working with numbers, 
templates, charts, graphs, and computing systems. A common denominator in all projects is people. 
People can be counted, but they are not numbers.
Leads and lags. A lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to 
a predecessor activity. For example, on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping 
could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduled punch list completion. This would be 
shown as a finish-to-start with a 2-week lead as shown in Figure 10-13. A lead is often represented 
as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.
A lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. 
For example, a technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after 
they begin writing it. This can be shown as a start-to-start relationship with a 15-day lag as shown 
in Figure 10-13. Lag can also be represented in project schedule network diagrams, as shown in 
Figure 10-14, in the relationship between activities H and I (as indicated by the nomenclature SS+10 
(start-to-start plus 10 days lag) even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale).

The project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to 
accurately define the logical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. 
Also, duration estimates do not include any leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions 
should be documented.
Logical data model. A logical data model is a visual representation of an organization’s data, 
described in business language and independent of any specific technology. A logical data model 
can be used to identify where data integrity or other quality issues can arise.
Make-or-buy analysis. A make-or-buy analysis is used to determine whether work or deliverables 
can best be accomplished by the project team or should be purchased from outside sources. Factors 
to consider in the make-or-buy decision include the organization’s current resource allocation and 
their skills and abilities, the need for specialized expertise, the desire to not expand permanent 
employment obligations, and the need for independent expertise. It also includes evaluating the 
risks involved with each make-or-buy decision.

Tools and Techniques
A make-or-buy analysis may use payback period, return on investment (ROI), internal rate of return 
(IRR), discounted cash flow, net present value (NPV), benefit/cost analysis (BCA), or other techniques 
in order to decide whether to include something as part of the project or purchase it externally.
Market research. Market research is a data gathering technique that includes examination of industry 
and specific seller capabilities. Procurement teams may leverage information gained at conferences, 
online reviews, and a variety of sources to identify market capabilities. The team may also refine 
specific procurement objectives to leverage maturing technologies while balancing risks associated 
with the breadth of sellers who can provide the desired materials or services.
Matrix diagrams. Matrix diagrams help to find the strength of relationships among different factors, 
causes, and objectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix. Depending 
on how many factors are compared, a project manager can use different shapes of matrix diagrams, 
for example, L, T, Y, X, C, and roof shaped. Matrix diagrams facilitate the identification of key quality 
metrics that are important for the success of the project.
Meeting management. An interpersonal and team skill used to ensure meetings meet their intended 
objectives effectively and efficiently. The following steps should be used for meeting planning:
▶	 Prepare and distribute the agenda stating the objectives of the meeting.
▶	 Ensure that the meeting starts and finishes at the published time.
▶	 Ensure the appropriate participants are invited and attend.
▶	 Stay on topic.
▶	 Manage expectations, issues, and conflicts during the meeting.
▶	 Record all actions along with the individual who has responsibility for completing the action.
Meetings. Project meetings can include virtual (e-meetings) or face-to-face meetings, and can 
be supported with document collaboration technologies, including email messages and project 
websites. Examples of meetings include but are not limited to the following:
▶	 Decision making,
▶	 Issue resolution,
▶	 Lessons learned and retrospectives,
▶	 Project kickoff,
▶	 Sprint planning, and
▶	 Status updates.

Mind mapping. Mind mapping consolidates ideas created through individual brainstorming sessions 
into a single map to reflect commonality and differences in understanding and to generate new 
ideas. Mind mapping is a diagrammatic method used to visually organize information.
Motivation. Motivation is providing a reason for someone to act. Teams are motivated by empowering 
them to participate in decision making and encouraging them to work independently.
Multicriteria decision analysis. This technique utilizes a decision matrix to provide a systematic 
analytical approach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, uncertainty, and valuation, to 
evaluate and rank many ideas. Multicriteria decision analysis tools (e.g., prioritization matrix) can 
be used to identify the key issues and suitable alternatives to be prioritized as a set of decisions for 
implementation. Criteria are prioritized and weighted before being applied to all available alternatives 
to obtain a mathematical score for each alternative. The alternatives are then ranked by score.
Negotiation. Negotiation is a discussion aimed at reaching an agreement. Negotiation is used to 
achieve support or agreement that supports the work of the project or its outcomes and to resolve 
conflicts within the team or with other stakeholders. Negotiation among team members is used to 
reach consensus on project needs. Negotiation can build trust and harmony among team members.
Procurement negotiation clarifies the structure, rights, and obligations of the parties and other 
terms of the purchases so that mutual agreement can be reached prior to signing a contract. Final 
document language reflects all agreements reached. Negotiation concludes with a signed contract 
document or other formal agreement that can be executed by both buyer and seller.
The negotiation should be led by a member of the procurement team who has the authority to sign 
contracts. The project manager and other members of the project management team may be present 
during negotiation to provide assistance as needed.
Networking. The establishment of connections and relationships with other people from the same 
or other organizations for the purpose of exchanging information and developing contacts. Networks 
provide project managers and their teams with access to informal organizations to solve problems, 
influence actions of their stakeholders, and increase stakeholder support for the work and outcomes 
of the project, thus improving performance.
Nonverbal. Examples of nonverbal communication include appropriate body language to transmit 
meaning through gestures, tone of voice, and facial expressions. Mirroring and eye contact are also 
important techniques. The team members should be aware of how they are expressing themselves, 
both through what they say and what they don’t say.

Tools and Techniques
Nominal group technique. A technique that enhances brainstorming with a voting process used 
to rank the most useful ideas for further brainstorming or for prioritization. The nominal group 
technique is a structured form of brainstorming consisting of four steps:
▶	 Step 1. A question or problem is posed to the group. Each person silently generates and 
writes down their ideas.
▶	 Step 2. The moderator writes down the ideas on a flip chart until all ideas are recorded.
▶	 Step 3. Each recorded idea is discussed until all group members have a clear understanding.
▶	 Step 4. Individuals vote privately to prioritize the ideas, usually using a scale of 1 to 5, 
with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. Voting may take place in many rounds to 
reduce and focus in on ideas. After each round, the moderator tallies the votes, and the 
highest scoring ideas are selected.
Observation/conversation. Observation and conversation provide a direct way of viewing 
individuals in their environment and to see how they perform their jobs or tasks and carry out 
processes. It is particularly helpful for detailed processes when the people who use the product 
have difficulty or are reluctant to articulate their requirements. Observation is also known as “job 
shadowing.” It is usually done externally by an observer viewing a business expert performing a job. 
It can also be done by a “participant observer” who performs a process or procedure to experience 
how it is done to uncover hidden requirements.
Organizational theory. Organizational theory provides information regarding the way in which 
people, teams, and organizational units behave. Effective use of common techniques identified in 
organizational theory can shorten the amount of time, cost, and effort needed to create the Plan 
Resource Management process outputs and improve planning efficiency. Applicable organizational 
theories may recommend exercising a flexible leadership style that adapts to the changes in a team’s 
maturity level throughout the project life cycle. It is important to recognize that the organization’s 
structure and culture impact the project organizational structure.
Parametric estimating. Parametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used 
to calculate cost or duration based on historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses 
a statistical relationship between historical data and other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) 
to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost, budget, and duration.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by 
the number of labor hours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated 
by the number of drawings multiplied by the number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable 
installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor hours per meter. If the assigned 
resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required to install 1,000 
meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).
This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying 
data built into the model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to 
segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods.
Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze actual performance  
of work in progress on the project against the schedule baseline, such as actual start and finish dates, 
percent complete, and remaining duration for work in progress.
Political awareness. Political awareness helps the project manager to plan communications based 
on the project environment as well as the organization’s political environment. Political awareness 
concerns the recognition of formal and informal power relationships and the willingness to operate 
within these structures. Aspects of political awareness include:
▶	 Understanding the strategies of the organization,
▶	 Knowing who wields power and influence in this arena, and
▶	 Developing an ability to communicate with these stakeholders.
Precedence diagramming method (PDM). A technique used for constructing a schedule model 
in which activities are represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical 
relationships to show the sequence in which the activities are to be performed.
PDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity 
that logically comes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent 
activity that logically comes after another activity in a schedule. These relationships are defined below 
and are illustrated in Figure 10-15:
▶	 Finish-to-start (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until 
a predecessor activity has finished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC 
(successor) cannot start until the PC hardware is assembled (predecessor).

285
Tools and Techniques
▶	 Finish-to-finish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until 
a predecessor activity has finished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is 
required to finish before editing the document (successor) can finish.
▶	 Start-to-start (SS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a 
predecessor activity has started. For example, leveling concrete (successor) cannot begin 
until pouring the foundation (predecessor) begins.
▶	 Start-to-finish (SF). A logical relationship in which a predecessor activity cannot finish until 
a successor activity has started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) 
has to start before the old accounts payable system can be shut down (predecessor).
In PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very 
rarely used, but it is included here to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types.
Two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example, SS and FF). Multiple 
relationships between the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select 
the relationship with the highest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.

Presentations. A presentation is the formal delivery of information and/or documentation. Clear 
and effective presentations of project information to relevant stakeholders can include but are not 
limited to:
▶	 Progress reports and information updates to stakeholders;
▶	 Background information to support decision making;
▶	 General information about the project and its objectives, for the purposes of raising  
the profile of the work of the project and the team; and
▶	 Specific information aimed at increasing understanding and support of the work and 
objectives of the project.
Presentations will be successful when the content and delivery take the following into account:
▶	 Expectations and needs of the audience; and
▶	 Needs and objectives of the project and project team.
Prioritization/ranking. Stakeholder requirements need to be prioritized and ranked, as do the 
stakeholders themselves. Stakeholders with the most interest and the highest influence are often 
prioritized at the top of the list.
Probability and impact matrix. A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability 
of each risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. This matrix specifies 
combinations of probability and impact that allow individual project risks to be divided into priority 
groups (see Figure 10-16). Risks can be prioritized for further analysis and planning of risk responses 
based on their probability and impacts. The probability of occurrence for each individual project risk 
is assessed as well as its impact on one or more project objectives if it does occur, using definitions 
of probability and impact for the project as specified in the risk management plan. Individual project 
risks are assigned to a priority level based on the combination of their assessed probability and 
impact, using a probability and impact matrix.
An organization can assess a risk separately for each objective (e.g., cost, time, and scope) by having 
a separate probability and impact matrix for each. Alternatively, it may develop ways to determine 
one overall priority level for each risk, either by combining assessments for different objectives, or by 
taking the highest priority level regardless of which objective is affected.

Tools and Techniques
Problem solving. Problem solving entails finding solutions for issues or challenges. It can include 
gathering additional information; critical thinking; and creative, quantitative, and/or logical 
approaches. Effective and systematic problem solving is a fundamental element in quality assurance 
and quality improvement. Problems can arise as a result of the Control Quality process or from 
quality audits and can be associated with a process or deliverable. Using a structured problem-
solving method will help eliminate the problem and develop a long-lasting solution. Problem-solving 
methods generally include the following actions:
▶	 Define the problem,
▶	 Identify the root cause,
▶	 Generate possible solutions,
▶	 Choose the best solution,
▶	 Implement the solution, and
▶	 Verify solution effectiveness.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Process analysis. Process analysis identifies opportunities for process improvements. This analysis 
also examines problems, constraints, and non-value-added activities that occur during a process.
Product analysis. Product analysis can be used to define products and services. It includes asking 
questions about a product or service and forming answers to describe the use, characteristics, and 
other relevant aspects of what is going to be manufactured or delivered.
Each application area has one or more generally accepted methods for translating high-level product 
or service descriptions into meaningful deliverables. Requirements are captured at a high level and 
decomposed to the level of detail needed to design the final product. Examples of product analysis 
techniques include but are not limited to:
▶	 Product breakdown,
▶	 Requirements analysis,
▶	 Systems analysis,
▶	 Systems engineering,
▶	 Value analysis, and
▶	 Value engineering.
Project management information system (PMIS). An information system consisting of the tools 
and techniques used to gather, integrate, and disseminate the outputs of project management 
processes. A PMIS provides access to information technology software tools, such as scheduling 
software tools, work authorization systems, configuration management systems, information 
collection and distribution systems, as well as interfaces to other online automated systems such 
as organizational knowledge repositories. Automated gathering and reporting on key performance 
indicators (KPIs) can be part of this system.
Project reporting. Project reporting is the act of collecting and distributing project information. 
Project information is distributed to many groups of stakeholders and should be adapted to provide 
information at an appropriate level, format, and detail for each type of stakeholder. The format 
may range from a simple communication to more elaborate custom reports and presentations. 
Information may be prepared regularly or on an exception basis. While work performance reports 
are the output of the Monitor and Control Project Work process, the Manage Communications 
process develops ad hoc reports, project presentations, blogs, and other types of communication 
about the project.

Tools and Techniques
Prompt lists. A prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual 
project risks and that could also act as sources of overall project risk. The prompt list can be used 
as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation when using risk identification techniques. 
The risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be used as a prompt list 
for individual project risks. Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying 
sources of overall project risk, for example PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, 
environmental), TECOP (technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political), or VUCA 
(volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity).
Proposal evaluation. Proposals are evaluated to ensure they are complete and respond in full to the 
bid documents, procurement statement of work, source selection criteria, and any other documents 
that went out in the bid package.
Prototypes. A method of obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a working model of 
the expected product before building it. Examples of prototypes are small-scale products, computer-
generated 2D and 3D models, mock-ups, or simulations. Prototypes allow stakeholders to experiment 
with a model of the final product rather than being limited to discussing abstract representations of 
their requirements. Prototypes support the concept of progressive elaboration in iterative cycles of 
mock-up creation, user experimentation, feedback generation, and prototype revision. When enough 
feedback cycles have been performed, the requirements obtained from the prototype are sufficiently 
complete to move to a design or build phase.
Storyboarding is a prototyping technique showing sequence or navigation through a series of images 
or illustrations. Storyboards are used on a variety of projects in a variety of industries, such as film, 
advertising, instructional design, and on agile and other software development projects. In software 
development, storyboards use mock-ups to show navigation paths through web pages, screens, or 
other user interfaces.
Quality improvement methods. Quality improvements can occur based on findings and 
recommendations from quality control processes, the findings of the quality audits, or problem 
solving in the Manage Quality process. Plan-do-check-act and Six Sigma are two of the most 
common quality improvement tools used to analyze and evaluate opportunities for improvement.
Questionnaires and surveys. Questionnaires and surveys are written sets of questions designed to 
quickly accumulate information from a large number of respondents. Questionnaires and/or surveys 
are most appropriate with varied audiences, when a quick turnaround is needed, when respondents 
are geographically dispersed, and where statistical analysis could be appropriate.

Recognition and rewards. Part of the team development process involves recognizing and rewarding 
desirable behavior. The original plan for rewarding people is developed during the Plan Resource 
Management process. Rewards will be effective only if they satisfy a need that is valued by that 
individual. Reward decisions are made, formally or informally, during the process of managing the 
project team. Cultural differences should be considered when determining recognition and rewards.
People are motivated when they feel they are valued in the organization and this value is demonstrated 
by the rewards given to them. Generally, money is viewed as a tangible aspect of any reward system, 
but intangible rewards could be equally or even more effective. Most project team members are 
motivated by an opportunity to grow, accomplish, be appreciated, and apply their professional skills to 
meet new challenges. A good strategy for project managers is to give the team recognition throughout 
the life cycle of the project rather than waiting until the project is completed.
Regression analysis. Regression analysis is an analytical technique where a series of input variables 
are examined in relation to their corresponding output results in order to develop a mathematical 
or statistical relationship. This technique analyzes the interrelationships between different project 
variables that contributed to project outcomes in order to improve performance on future projects.
Representations of uncertainty. Quantitative risk analysis requires inputs to a quantitative risk 
analysis model that reflect individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty.
Where the duration, cost, or resource requirement for a planned activity is uncertain, the range of 
possible values can be represented in the model as a probability distribution. The most commonly 
used forms are triangular, normal, lognormal, beta, uniform, or discrete distributions. Care should be 
taken when selecting an appropriate probability distribution to reflect the range of possible values 
for the planned activity.
Individual project risks may be covered by probability distributions. Alternatively, risks may be included 
in the model as probabilistic branches, where optional activities are added to the model to represent 
the time and/or cost impact of the risk should it occur, and the chance that these activities actually 
occur in a particular simulation run matches the risk’s probability. Branches are most useful for risks 
that might occur independently of any planned activity. Where risks are related, for example, with a 
common cause or a logical dependency, correlation is used in the model to indicate this relationship.
Other sources of uncertainty may be represented using branches to describe alternative paths 
through the project.

Tools and Techniques
Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is an analytical technique to determine the essential features and 
relationships of components in the project management plan in order to establish a reserve for the 
schedule duration, budget, estimated cost, or funds for a project.
Cost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances) to account 
for cost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated for 
identified risks. Contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget intended to address 
the known-unknowns that can affect a project. For example, rework for some project deliverables could 
be anticipated, while the amount of this rework is unknown. Contingency reserves may be estimated to 
account for this unknown amount of rework. Contingency reserves can be provided at any level from 
the specific activity to the entire project. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated 
cost, a fixed number, or may be developed by using quantitative analysis methods.
As more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, 
reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identified in the cost documentation. Contingency 
reserves are part of the cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project.
Resource optimization. Resource optimization is used to adjust the start and finish dates of 
activities to adjust planned resource use to be equal to or less than resource availability. Examples 
of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the schedule model due to demand 
and supply of resources include but are not limited to:
▶	 Resource leveling. A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on 
resource constraints with the goal of balancing the demand for resources with the 
available supply. Resource leveling can be used when shared or critically required 
resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are overallocated, 
such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same 
time period (as shown in Figure 10-17), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a 
constant level. Resource leveling can often cause the original critical path to change. 
Available float is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the critical path through the 
project schedule may change.
▶	 Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that 
the requirements for resources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource 
limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed to resource leveling, the project’s critical path is 
not changed, and the completion date may not be delayed. In other words, activities may 
only be delayed within their free and total float. Resource smoothing may not be able to 
optimize all resources.

Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM). A grid that shows the project resources assigned to each 
work package. A RAM shows the project resources assigned to each work package. It is used to illustrate 
the connections between work packages, or activities, and project team members. On larger projects, 
RAMs can be developed at various levels. For example, a high-level RAM can define the responsibilities 
of a project team, group, or unit within each component of the WBS. Lower-level RAMs are used within 
the group to designate roles, responsibilities, and levels of authority for specific activities. The matrix 
format shows all activities associated with one person and all people associated with one activity. This 
also ensures that there is only one person accountable for any one task to avoid confusion about who 
is ultimately in charge or has authority for the work. One example of a RAM is a RACI (responsible, 
accountable, consulted, and informed) chart, shown in Figure 10-18. The sample chart shows the work 
to be done in the left column as activities. The assigned resources can be shown as individuals or 
groups. The project manager can select other options, such as “lead” and “resource” designations, as 
appropriate for the project. A RACI chart is a useful tool to ensure the clear assignment of roles and 
responsibilities when the team consists of internal and external resources.

Risk categorization. Risks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (e.g., using the 
risk breakdown structure [RBS]); the area of the project affected (e.g., using the work breakdown 
structure [WBS]); or other useful categories (e.g., project phase, project budget, and roles and 
responsibilities) to determine the areas of the project most exposed to the effects of uncertainty. 
Risks can also be categorized by common root causes. Risk categories that may be used for the 
project are defined in the risk management plan.
Grouping risks into categories can lead to the development of more effective risk responses by 
focusing attention and effort on the areas of highest risk exposure, or by developing generic risk 
responses to address groups of related risks.
Risk data quality assessment. Risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data 
about individual project risks is accurate and reliable as a basis for qualitative risk analysis. The use 
of low-quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis that is of little use to the project. If data 
quality is unacceptable, it may be necessary to gather better data. Risk data quality may be assessed 
via a questionnaire measuring the project’s stakeholder perceptions of various characteristics, which 
may include completeness, objectivity, relevancy, and timeliness. A weighted average of selected data 
quality characteristics can then be generated to give an overall quality score.
Risk probability and impact assessment. Risk probability assessment considers the likelihood 
that a specific risk will occur. Risk impact assessment considers the potential effect on one or 
more project objectives such as schedule, cost, quality, or performance. Impacts will be negative 
for threats and positive for opportunities. Probability and impact are assessed for each identified 
individual project risk. Risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings with participants selected 
for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the risk register. Project team members and 
knowledgeable persons external to the project are included. The level of probability for each risk 
and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the interview or meeting. Differences in the 
levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected, and such differences 
should be explored. Explanatory detail, including assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are 
also recorded. Risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the definitions given in the risk 
management plan. Risks with low probability and impact may be included within the risk register 
as part of a watch list for future monitoring. Refer to Table 9-2 for an example of definitions of 
probability and impacts.

Tools and Techniques
Rolling wave planning. Rolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work 
to be accomplished in the near term is planned in detail, while work further in the future is planned 
at a higher level. It is a form of progressive elaboration applicable to work packages, planning 
packages, and release planning when using an agile or waterfall approach. Therefore, work can exist 
at various levels of detail depending on where it is in the project life cycle. During early strategic 
planning when information is less defined, work packages may be decomposed to the known level 
of detail. As more is known about the upcoming events in the near term, work packages can be 
decomposed into activities.
Root cause analysis. Root cause analysis is an analytical technique used to determine the basic 
underlying reason that causes a variance, defect, or risk. A root cause may underlie more than one 
variance, defect, or risk. It may also be used as a technique for identifying root causes of a problem 
and solving them. When all root causes for a problem are removed, the problem does not recur.
Scatter diagrams. A scatter diagram is a graph that shows the relationship between two variables. 
Scatter diagrams can demonstrate a relationship between any element of a process, environment, 
or activity on one axis and a quality defect on the other axis.
Schedule compression. Schedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the 
schedule duration without reducing the project scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed 
dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful technique is the negative float analysis. The critical 
path is the one with the least float. Due to violating a constraint or imposed date, the total float can 
become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 10-19 and include:
▶	 Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental 
cost by adding resources. Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing 
in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery to activities on the critical path. 
Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources will 
shorten the activity’s duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative  
and may result in increased risk and/or cost.
▶	 Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done 
in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is 
constructing the foundation for a building before completing all of the architectural drawings. 
Fast tracking may result in rework and increased risk. Fast tracking only works when activities 
can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical path. Using leads in case of 
schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities concerned 
and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.

Schedule network analysis. Schedule network analysis is a technique to identify early and late 
start dates, including early and late finish dates, for the uncompleted portions of project activities. 
Schedule network analysis is the overarching technique used to generate the project schedule model. 
It employs several other techniques such as critical path method, resource optimization techniques, 
and modeling techniques. Additional analysis includes but is not limited to:
▶	 Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule 
slip when multiple paths converge at a single point in time, or when multiple paths diverge 
from a single point in time, to reduce the probability of a schedule slip.
▶	 Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has high-risk activities or long-lead items 
that would necessitate use of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses 
to reduce the risk on the critical path.
Schedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model  
is developed.

Sensitivity analysis. An analysis technique to determine which individual project risks or other 
sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes, by correlating variations 
in project outcomes with variations in elements of a quantitative risk analysis model.
Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty 
have the most potential impact on project outcomes. It correlates variations in project outcomes with 
variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model.
One typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram, which presents the calculated 
correlation coefficient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can influence 
the project outcome. This can include individual project risks, project activities with high degrees of 
variability, or specific sources of ambiguity. Items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, 
giving the typical tornado appearance. An example tornado diagram is shown in Figure 10-20.

Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources 
of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common 
simulation technique is Monte Carlo analysis, in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are 
used to calculate possible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating 
multiple work package durations with different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, 
issues, or scenarios using probability distributions and other representations of uncertainty. 
Figure 10-21 shows a probability distribution for a project with the probability of achieving a certain 
target date (i.e., project finish date). In this example, there is a 10% probability that the project will 
finish on or before the target date of 13 May 2022, while there is a 90% probability of completing 
the project by 28 May 2022.
For more information on how Monte Carlo simulation is used for schedule models, see the Practice 
Standard for Scheduling [8].

Source selection analysis. It is necessary to review the prioritization of the competing demands 
for the project before deciding on the selection method. Since competitive selection methods may 
require sellers to invest a large amount of time and resources up front, it is a good practice to include 
the evaluation method in the bid documents so bidders know how they will be evaluated. Commonly 
used selection methods include the following:
▶	 Least cost. The least cost method may be appropriate for procurements of a standard 
or routine nature where well-established practices and standards exist and from which a 
specific and well-defined outcome is expected, which can be executed at different costs.
▶	 Qualifications only. The qualifications only selection method applies when the time and 
cost of a full selection process would not make sense because the value of the procurement 
is relatively small. The buyer establishes a short list and selects the bidder with the best 
credibility, qualifications, experience, expertise, areas of specialization, and references.
▶	 Quality-based/highest technical proposal score. The selected firm is asked to submit  
a proposal with both technical and cost details and is then invited to negotiate the contract 
if the technical proposal proves acceptable. Using this method, technical proposals are first 
evaluated based on the quality of the technical solution offered. The seller who submitted 
the highest-ranked technical proposal is selected if their financial proposal can be negotiated 
and accepted.
▶	 Quality- and cost-based. The quality- and cost-based method allows cost to be included 
as a factor in the seller selection process. In general, when risk and/or uncertainty are 
greater for the project, quality should be a key element when compared to cost.
▶	 Sole source. The buyer asks a specific seller to prepare technical and financial proposals, 
which are then negotiated. Since there is no competition, this method is acceptable only 
when properly justified and should be viewed as an exception.
▶	 Fixed budget. The fixed-budget method requires disclosing the available budget 
to invited sellers in the request for proposal (RFP) and selecting the highest-ranking 
technical proposal within the budget. Because sellers are subject to a cost constraint, they 
will adapt the scope and quality of their offer to that budget. The buyer should therefore 
ensure that the budget is compatible with the statement of work (SOW) and that the 
seller will be able to perform the tasks within the budget. This method is appropriate only 
when the SOW is precisely defined, no changes are anticipated, and the budget is fixed 
and cannot be exceeded.

Stakeholder analysis. Stakeholder analysis results in a list of stakeholders and relevant information 
such as their positions in the organization, roles on the project, “stakes,” expectations, attitudes (their 
levels of support for the project), and their interest in information about the project. Stakeholders’ 
stakes can include but are not limited to a combination of:
▶	 Interest. A person or group can be affected by a decision related to the project  
or its outcomes.
▶	 Rights (legal or moral rights). Legal rights, such as occupational health and safety, may 
be defined in the legislation framework of a country. Moral rights may involve concepts 
of protection of historical sites or environmental sustainability.
▶	 Ownership. A person or group has a legal title to an asset or a property.
▶	 Knowledge. Specialist knowledge, which can benefit the project through more effective 
delivery of project objectives, organizational outcomes, or knowledge of the power 
structures of the organization.
▶	 Contribution. Provision of funds or other resources, including human resources, or 
providing support for the project in more intangible ways, such as advocacy in the form 
of promoting the objectives of the project or acting as a buffer between the project and 
the power structures of the organization and its politics.
Stakeholder engagement assessment matrix. A stakeholder engagement assessment matrix 
supports comparison between the current engagement levels of stakeholders and the desired 
engagement levels required for successful project delivery. One way to classify the engagement 
level of stakeholders is shown in Figure 10-22. The engagement level of stakeholders can be 
classified as follows:
▶	 Unaware. Unaware of the project and potential impacts.
▶	 Resistant. Aware of the project and potential impacts but resistant to any changes that 
may occur as a result of the work or outcomes of the project. These stakeholders will be 
unsupportive of the work or outcomes of the project.
▶	 Neutral. Aware of the project, but neither supportive nor unsupportive.
▶	 Supportive. Aware of the project and potential impacts and supportive of the work  
and its outcomes.
▶	 Leading. Aware of the project and potential impacts and actively engaged in ensuring  
that the project is a success.

Tools and Techniques
In Figure 10-22, C represents the current engagement level of each stakeholder and D indicates the 
level that the project team has assessed as essential to ensure project success (desired). The gap 
between current and desired for each stakeholder will direct the level of communications necessary 
to effectively engage the stakeholder. The closing of this gap between current and desired is an 
essential element of monitoring stakeholder engagement.
Stakeholder mapping/representation. Stakeholder mapping and representation is a method of 
categorizing stakeholders using various methods. Categorizing stakeholders assists the team in 
building relationships with the identified project stakeholders. Common methods include:
▶	 Power/interest grid, power/influence grid, or impact/influence grid. Each of these 
techniques supports a grouping of stakeholders according to their level of authority 
(power), level of concern about the project’s outcomes (interest), ability to influence the 
outcomes of the project (influence), or ability to cause changes to the project’s planning 
or execution. These classification models are useful for small projects or for projects with 
simple relationships between stakeholders and the project, or within the stakeholder 
community itself.
▶	 Stakeholder cube. This is a refinement of the grid models previously mentioned. This 
model combines the grid elements into a three-dimensional model that can be useful to 
project managers and teams in identifying and engaging their stakeholder community. 
It provides a model with multiple dimensions that improves the depiction of the 
stakeholder community as a multidimensional entity and assists with the development 
of communication strategies.

▶	 Salience model. The salience model describes classes of stakeholders based on assessments 
of their power (level of authority or ability to influence the outcomes of the project), urgency 
(need for immediate attention, either time-constrained or relating to the stakeholders’ 
high stakes in the outcome), and legitimacy (their involvement is appropriate). There is an 
adaptation of the salience model that substitutes proximity for legitimacy (applying to the 
team and measuring their level of involvement with the work of the project). The salience 
model is useful for large, complex communities of stakeholders or where there are complex 
networks of relationships within the community. It is also useful in determining the relative 
importance of the identified stakeholders.
▶	 Directions of influence. This technique classifies stakeholders according to their influence 
on the work of the project or the project team itself. Stakeholders can be classified in the 
following ways:
▹	
Upward (senior management of the performing organization or customer organization, 
sponsor, and steering committee),
▹	
Downward (the team or specialists contributing knowledge or skills in a temporary 
capacity),
▹	
Outward (stakeholder groups and their representatives outside the project team, such 
as suppliers, government departments, the public, end users, and regulators), or
▹	
Sideward (the peers of the project manager, such as other project managers or middle 
managers who are in competition for scarce project resources or who collaborate with 
the project manager in sharing resources or information).
▶	 Prioritization. Prioritizing stakeholders may be necessary for projects with a large 
number of stakeholders, where the membership of the stakeholder community is 
changing frequently, or when the relationships between stakeholders and the project 
team or within the stakeholder community are complex.
Statistical sampling. Statistical sampling involves choosing part of a population of interest for 
inspection (for example, selecting 10 engineering drawings at random from a list of 75). The sample 
is taken to measure controls and verify quality. Sample frequency and sizes should be determined 
during the Plan Quality Management process.

Tools and Techniques
Strategies for overall project risk. Risk responses should be planned and implemented not only for 
individual project risks but also to address overall project risk. The same risk response strategies that 
are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to overall project risk:
▶	 Avoid. Where the level of overall project risk is significantly negative and outside the agreed-
upon risk thresholds for the project, an avoid strategy may be adopted. This involves taking 
focused action to reduce the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and 
bring the project back within the thresholds. An example of avoidance at the overall project 
level would include removal of high-risk elements of scope from the project. Where it is not 
possible to bring the project back within the thresholds, the project may be canceled. This 
represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the 
overall level of threat is, and will remain, unacceptable.
▶	 Exploit. Where the level of overall project risk is significantly positive and outside the 
agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. This 
involves taking focused action to capture the positive effect of uncertainty on the project 
as a whole. An example of exploiting at the overall project level would include addition 
of high-benefit elements of scope to the project to add value or benefits to stakeholders. 
Alternatively the risk thresholds for the project may be modified with the agreement of 
key stakeholders in order to embrace the opportunity.
▶	 Transfer/share. If the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable 
to address it effectively, a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the 
organization. Where overall project risk is negative, a transfer strategy is required, which may 
involve payment of a risk premium. In the case of high positive overall project risk, ownership 
may be shared in order to reap the associated benefits. Examples of both transfer and share 
strategies for overall project risk include but are not limited to setting up a collaborative 
business structure in which the buyer and the seller share the overall project risk, launching  
a joint venture or special-purpose company, or subcontracting key elements of the project.
▶	 Mitigate/enhance. These strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to 
optimize the chances of achieving the project’s objectives. The mitigation strategy is used 
where overall project risk is negative, and enhancement applies when it is positive. Examples 
of mitigation or enhancement strategies include replanning the project, changing the scope 
and boundaries of the project, modifying project priority, changing resource allocations, 
adjusting delivery times, etc.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
▶	 Accept. Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project 
risk, the organization may choose to continue with the project as currently defined, even 
if overall project risk is outside the agreed-upon thresholds. Acceptance can be either 
active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish an overall 
contingency reserve for the project, including amounts of time, money, or resources to be 
used if the project exceeds its thresholds. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action 
apart from periodic review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not 
change significantly.
Strategies for threats. There are five alternative strategies that may be considered for dealing with 
threats, as follows:
▶	 Escalate. Escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees 
that a threat is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would 
exceed the project manager’s authority. Escalated risks are managed at the program level, 
portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, but not on the project level. The 
project manager determines who should be notified about the threat and communicates 
the details to that person or part of the organization. It is important that the ownership of 
escalated threats is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. Threats are usually 
escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the threat 
occurred. Escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, 
although they may be recorded in the risk register for information.
▶	 Avoid. Risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the 
project from its impact. Avoidance may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high 
probability of occurrence and a large negative impact. Avoidance may involve changing 
some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective that is in jeopardy 
in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. The 
risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk’s impact if it 
were to occur. Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, 
extending the schedule, changing the project strategy, or reducing scope. Some risks can  
be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, improving communication,  
or acquiring expertise.

Tools and Techniques
▶	 Transfer. Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the 
risk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs. Risk transfer often involves the payment  
of a risk premium to the party taking on the threat. The risk transfer can be achieved  
by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance, performance 
bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and 
liability for specified risks to another party.
▶	 Mitigate. In risk mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or 
impact of a threat. Early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the 
damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting less complex processes, conducting more 
tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation actions. Mitigation 
may involve prototype development to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale 
model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation 
response might reduce the impact by targeting the factors that drive the severity. For 
example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure  
of the original component.
▶	 Accept. Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is 
taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted 
where it is not possible or cost-effective to address a threat in any other way. Acceptance 
can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish 
a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the threat 
if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of 
the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly.
Strategies for opportunities. There are five alternative strategies that may be considered for 
dealing with opportunities, as follows:
▶	 Escalate. This risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project 
sponsor agrees that an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed 
response would exceed the project manager’s authority. Escalated opportunities are 
managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, and 
not on the project level. The project manager determines who should be notified about the 
opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. It is 
important that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the 
organization. Opportunities are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that 
would be affected if the opportunity occurred. Escalated opportunities are not monitored 
further by the project team after escalation, although they may be recorded in the risk 
register for information.

▶	 Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the 
organization wants to ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to 
capture the benefit associated with a particular opportunity by ensuring that it definitely 
happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. Examples of exploiting 
responses may include assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project 
to reduce the time to completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to 
reduce cost and duration.
▶	 Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that 
it shares some of the benefit if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new 
owner of a shared opportunity carefully, so they are best able to capture the opportunity 
for the benefit of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a risk premium to the 
party taking on the opportunity. Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing 
partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures.
▶	 Enhance. The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or impact of an 
opportunity. Early enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the 
benefit after the opportunity has occurred. The probability of occurrence of an opportunity 
may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it is not possible to increase 
probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors that 
drive the size of the potential benefit. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding 
more resources to an activity to finish early.
▶	 Accept. Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is 
taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be 
adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address an opportunity in any other 
way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance 
strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or 
resources to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves 
no proactive action apart from periodic review of the opportunity to ensure that it does 
not change significantly.

Tools and Techniques
SWOT analysis. The analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of an 
organization, project, or option. This technique examines a project from each of the strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) perspectives. For risk identification, it is used to 
increase the breadth of identified risks by including internally generated risks. The technique 
starts with the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the organization, focusing on 
either the project, organization, or the business area in general. SWOT analysis then identifies 
any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from 
weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset 
threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.
Team building. Team building is conducting activities that enhance the team’s social relations and 
build a collaborative and cooperative working environment. Team-building activities can vary from 
a 5-minute agenda item in a status review meeting to an off-site, professionally facilitated event 
designed to improve interpersonal relationships. The objective of team-building activities is to 
help individual team members work together effectively. Team-building strategies are particularly 
valuable when team members operate from remote locations without the benefit of face-to-face 
contact. Informal communication and activities can help in building trust and establishing good 
working relationships. While team building is essential during the initial stages of a project, it should 
be a continuous process. Changes in a project environment are inevitable, and to manage them 
effectively, a continuous or renewed team-building effort may be applied. The project manager 
should continually monitor team functionality and performance to determine if any actions are 
needed to prevent or correct various team problems.
Technical performance analysis. Technical performance analysis compares technical 
accomplishments during project execution to the schedule of technical achievement. It requires 
the definition of objective, quantifiable measures of technical performance, which can be used to 
compare actual results against targets. Such technical performance measures may include weight, 
transaction times, number of delivered defects, storage capacity, etc. Deviation can indicate the 
potential impact of threats or opportunities.
Test and inspection planning. During the planning phase, the project manager and the project team 
determine how to test or inspect the product, deliverable, or service to meet the stakeholders’ needs 
and expectations, as well as how to meet the goal for the product’s performance and reliability. The 
tests and inspections are industry dependent and can include, for example, alpha and beta tests in 
software projects, strength tests in construction projects, inspection in manufacturing, and field tests 
and nondestructive tests in engineering.

Testing/product evaluations. Testing is an organized and constructed investigation conducted to 
provide objective information about the quality of the product or service under test in accordance 
with the project requirements. The intent of testing is to find errors, defects, bugs, or other 
nonconformance problems in the product or service. The type, amount, and extent of tests needed 
to evaluate each requirement are part of the project quality plan and depend on the nature of the 
project, time, budget, and other constraints. Tests can be performed throughout the project, as 
different components of the project become available, and at the end of the project on the final 
deliverables. Early testing helps identify nonconformance problems and helps reduce the cost of 
fixing the nonconforming components.
Different application areas require different tests. For example, software testing may include unit 
testing, integration testing, black-box, white-box, interface testing, regression testing, alpha testing, 
etc. In construction projects, testing may include cement strength, concrete workability tests, non-
destructive tests at construction sites for testing the quality of hardened concrete structures, and 
soil tests. In hardware development, testing may include environmental stress screening, burn-in 
tests, system testing, and more.
Text-oriented formats. Team member responsibilities that require detailed descriptions can be 
specified in text-oriented formats. Usually in outline form, these documents provide information 
such as responsibilities, authority, competencies, and qualifications. The documents are known 
by various names including position descriptions and role-responsibility-authority forms. These 
documents can be used as templates for future projects, especially when the information is 
updated throughout the current project by applying lessons learned.
Three-point estimating. The accuracy of single-point duration estimates may be improved by 
considering estimation uncertainty and risk. Using three-point estimates helps define an approximate 
range for an activity’s duration:
▶	 Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources 
likely to be assigned, their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, 
dependencies on other participants, and interruptions.
▶	 Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the best-case scenario  
for the activity.
▶	 Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity.

Tools and Techniques
Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected 
duration, tE, can be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution:
tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3.
Triangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental 
data. Duration estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected 
duration and clarify the range of uncertainty around the expected duration.
To-complete performance index (TCPI). The to-complete performance index (TCPI) is a measure 
of the cost performance that is required to be achieved with the remaining resources in order to 
meet a specified management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish the outstanding 
work to the remaining budget. TCPI is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved 
on the remaining work to meet a specified management goal, such as the budget at completion 
(BAC) or estimate at completion (EAC). If it becomes obvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the 
project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC may replace the BAC 
in the TCPI calculation. The equation for TCPI is: (BAC − EV) / (BAC − AC) where: BAC = budget at 
completion, EV = earned value, and AC = actual cost.
The TCPI is conceptually displayed in Figure 10-23. The equation for the TCPI is shown in the lower 
left as the work remaining (defined as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining (which 
can be either the BAC minus the AC, or the EAC minus the AC).
If the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline (as shown in Figure 10-23), all future work of the project 
will need to be performed immediately in the range of the TCPI (BAC) (as reflected in the top line of 
Figure 10-23) to stay within the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is 
a judgment call based on several considerations, including risk, time remaining in the project, and 
technical performance. This level of performance is displayed as the TCPI (EAC) line. The equation for 
the TCPI is based on the EAC: (BAC − EV) / (EAC − AC). The EVM formulas are provided in Table 10-1.

Process Groups: A Practice Guide
Training. Training includes all activities designed to enhance the competencies of the project team 
members. Training can be formal or informal. Examples of training methods include classroom, 
online, computer-based, on-the-job training from another project team member, mentoring, and 
coaching. If project team members lack the necessary management or technical skills, such skills 
can be developed as part of the project work.
Scheduled training takes place as stated in the resource management plan. Unplanned training 
takes place as a result of observation, conversation, and project performance appraisals conducted 
during management of the project team. Training costs could be included in the project budget or 
supported by the performing organization if the added skills may be useful for future projects. It 
may be performed by in-house or by external trainers.
Trend analysis. An analytical technique that uses mathematical models to forecast future 
outcomes based on historical results. It looks ahead in the project for expected slippages and 
warns the project manager ahead of time that there may be problems later in the schedule if 
established trends persist. This information is made available early enough in the project time line 
to give the project team time to analyze and correct any anomalies. The results of trend analysis 
can be used to recommend preventive actions if necessary.
Variance analysis. An analytical technique that uses mathematical models to forecast future outcomes 
based on historical results. Variance analysis reviews the differences (or variances) between planned 
and actual performance. This can include duration estimates, cost estimates, resources utilization, 
resources rates, technical performance, and other metrics.
Variance analysis reviews the variances from an integrated perspective considering cost, time, 
technical, and resource variances in relation to each other to get an overall view of variance on the 
project. This allows for the appropriate preventive or corrective actions to be initiated.
Voting. Voting is a collective decision-making technique and an assessment process having multiple 
alternatives with an expected outcome in the form of future actions. These techniques can be used 
to generate, classify, and prioritize product requirements. Examples of voting techniques include:
▶	 Unanimity. A decision that is reached whereby everyone agrees on a single course of action.
▶	 Majority. A decision that is reached with support obtained from more than 50% of the 
members of the group. Having a group size with an uneven number of participants can 
ensure that a decision will be reached rather than resulting in a tie.
▶	 Plurality. A decision that is reached whereby the largest block in a group decides, even 
if a majority is not achieved. This method is generally used when the number of options 
nominated is more than two.

Tools and Techniques
What-if scenario analysis. What-if scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in 
order to predict their effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the 
question, “What if the situation represented by scenario X happens?” A schedule network analysis 
is performed using the schedule to compute the different scenarios, such as delaying a major 
component delivery, extending specific engineering durations, or introducing external factors, such 
as a strike or a change in the permit process. The outcome of the what-if scenario analysis can be 
used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and in preparing 
schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations.

This glossary generally does not include:
▶ Application area-specific terms.
▶ Terms used in project management that do not differ in any material way from everyday 
use (e.g., calendar day, delay).
▶ Compound terms whose meaning is clear from the meanings of the component parts.
▶ Variants when the meaning of the variant is clear from the base term.
▶ Terms that are used only once and are not critical to understanding the point of the sentence.

that are required to complete an activity.
Activity List. A documented tabulation of schedule activities that shows the activity description, 
activity identifier, and a sufficiently detailed scope of work description so project team members 
understand what work is to be performed.
Activity-on-Node (AON). See precedence diagramming method (PDM).
Actual Cost (AC). The realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a specific 
time period.
Actual Duration. The time in calendar units between the actual start date of the schedule activity 
and either the data date of the project schedule if the schedule activity is in progress or the actual 
finish date if the schedule activity is complete.
Adaptive Life Cycle. A project life cycle that is iterative or incremental.
Affinity Diagrams. A technique that allows large numbers of ideas to be classified into groups for 
review and analysis.
Agile Life Cycle. See adaptive life cycle.
Agreements. Any document or communication that defines the initial intentions of a project. This 
can take the form of a contract, memorandum of understanding (MOU), letters of agreement, verbal 
agreements, email, etc.
