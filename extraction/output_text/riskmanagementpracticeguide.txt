Preface
Preface
Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide is a supplemental 
resource aligned with the PMI series of American National Standards Institute (ANSI)-approved 
standards, bringing consistency to the customer experience across the PMI publications portfolio. 
Organizations must adapt their visions, missions, and objectives to changing environments; 
therefore, PMI practice guides are evolving with them. In addition, the goal of A Guide to the 
Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) is to adapt and implement new project 
management perspectives and the approaches used to increase benefits and generate value for 
organizations.
This presents a new opportunity to align Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A 
Practice Guide with those shifting perspectives related to risk management. During the last few years 
in particular, new trends have emerged; new management skills are requested in the market; and 
people continue to improve their capabilities, increasing their knowledge and developing abilities 
to contribute to the objectives of their organizations.
The PMBOK® Guide—Seventh Edition made several changes in the structure and content of the 
guide, with an enhanced focus on delivering value to organizations and their stakeholders. Those 
changes were incorporated in the new Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A 
Practice Guide, changing the Knowledge Areas to the eight project management performance 
domains, aligning the concept of a system for value delivery, implementing agile approaches in the 
risk management process, and including a case study to make the content more relatable to project 
managers.
The new Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide also aligns risk 
management more closely with the updated PMI Talent Triangle®, integrating the required skills in 
Ways of Working, Business Acumen, and Power Skills. These new ways of working will help project 
professionals navigate business changes and connect outcomes to generating greater value for 
organizations. Part of the objective of Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A 
Practice Guide is to identify the risk management skills that organizations need to increase project 
success and value.
The previous edition of The Standard for Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects 
focused on processes, tools, and techniques, and was aligned with the Process Groups and 
Knowledge Areas. Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide responds 
to the elements that stakeholders have requested in their feedback: It improves the usefulness of 
the techniques, tools, processes, and good practices of risk management; aligns risk management 
practices with performance domains and portfolio, program, and project management principles; 
and is focused on realizing benefits and value through project outputs and outcomes.

Introduction

Introduction
Risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or 
more project objectives. Positive risks are opportunities, while negative risks are threats.
The practice of risk management includes developing a strategy for identifying, analyzing, and 
prioritizing risks; planning and implementing appropriate responses; and monitoring risks on an 
ongoing basis until the portfolio, program, or project is completed. Identified risks may or may not 
materialize, but it is important to monitor them as they can have a significant impact on a portfolio, 
program, project, or operations. Consequently, risk management is an essential aspect of the 
business environment and organizational activities. This practice guide describes the application of 
risk management within an enterprise risk management (ERM) context that includes the portfolio, 
program, and project levels. Ultimately, risk management shapes the decision-making processes 
across the organization and within each of its components.
Risk management is essential for portfolios, programs, and projects to be successful; to be delivered 
on time with quality; and to fully realize the benefits and value these components bring to their 
organizations. A vital technical and managerial skill, risk management is also augmented by “soft” 
or “interpersonal” skills that foster collaboration with others and empower project professionals 
to succeed in the workplace. Furthermore, this dynamic range of abilities, also known as “power 
skills,” significantly enhances the performance of multiple key drivers of success, including benefits 
realization management (BRM) maturity, organization agility, and project management maturity, 
according to the PMI Pulse of the Profession®—Power Skills: Redefining Project Success report [1].1
Risk management allows an organization to:
•	 Anticipate and manage change;
•	 Cultivate a corporate culture that balances risk, creativity, innovation, safety, and thoughtfulness;
•	 Be more agile and adaptable to lean innovation and startups, while also supporting 
organizational agility and resilience;
•	 Improve decision-making process;
•	 Proactively implement potentially lower-cost/time preventive actions instead of higher-cost/time 
corrective actions to issues;
•	 Engage stakeholders effectively;
•	 Increase the chances to realize opportunities for the benefit of the organization;
•	 Integrate sustainable, continuous improvement throughout the life cycle of the portfolio, 
program, or project;
•	 Promote awareness of uncertainties and associated impacts; and
•	 Act upon the transformations taking place in the organizational environment.
Risk management also establishes interconnected relationships among portfolios, programs, and 
projects—working with different approaches and frameworks such as adaptive, predictive, or 
hybrid—and links these connections to ERM and organizational strategy, with a focus on value

delivery. As a result, this practice guide is useful and applicable to any organization, regardless of 
industry, location, size, or approach.
1.1 Purpose of This Practice Guide
This practice guide describes the concepts and definitions associated with risk management 
and highlights the essential components of risk management for integration into the various 
management and governance layers of portfolios, programs, and projects—with the following 
major objectives:
•	 Describe the fundamentals of risk management,
•	 Support the objectives of ERM and demonstrate how activities link to ERM, and
•	 Apply risk management principles, as appropriate, to portfolio, program, and project 
management performance domains as described in PMI standards.
This practice guide fulfills an organizational need to provide good practices for risk management 
in portfolio, program, and project management that defines the essential considerations for risk 
management practitioners. It expands upon the existing knowledge contained within the relevant 
sections of PMI standards.
This practice guide can be used to harmonize practices among ERM and portfolio, program, 
and project management, regardless of the life cycle approach taken for delivering value to the 
organization’s strategy. In addition, organizations are increasingly requiring practitioners to use risk 
management practices in portfolio, program, and project management as integral parts of their 
ERM framework.
1.2 Approach of This Practice Guide
This practice guide presents the why, what, and how of risk management and elaborates on the 
following concepts:
•	 Purpose and benefits of risk management;
•	 Principles and concepts of risk management in portfolios, programs, and projects;
•	 Risk management life cycle in portfolios, programs, and projects; and
•	 Integration of risk management within portfolios, programs, and projects.
This practice guide provides guidance on integrating risk management practices into all key areas of 
enterprise, portfolio, program, and project management. Its aim is to ensure that risk management 
is considered as an inherent and natural part of all management levels. This practice guide also 
strives to provide direction and guidance while avoiding the imposition of uniformity of processes. 
Furthermore, this practice guide focuses more on intended outcomes than on deliverables, thus 
aligning to the principles-based approach adopted for A Guide to the Project Management Body of 
Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) [2].
When planning and implementing risk management, it is essential that each team considers the 
characteristics of its organization, portfolio, program, or project and tailors its risk management 
approach accordingly. For example, in adaptive and hybrid project environments, the need for 
ongoing feedback is greater because the project teams are exploring and developing project

Introduction
elements within specific increments. Also, the requirements for adaptive projects are not well 
defined at the start, so a stronger emphasis on iterative risk management is needed because of the 
higher level of uncertainty. The approaches and techniques presented in this practice guide are 
based on risk management principles that can be applied when designing specific management or 
business processes adapted to the organizational environment and nature of the work.
1.3 Audience for This Practice Guide
This practice guide provides guidance to stakeholders participating in a portfolio, program, 
or project. This includes, but is not limited to, portfolio managers, program managers, project 
managers, project coordinators, project practitioners, project planners, business analysts, risk 
managers, risk consultants, consultants, agile practitioners, agile consultants, product owners, 
sponsors, and vendors who:
•	 Work on a portfolio, program, project, or initiative either full or part time;
•	 Work in a portfolio, program, or project management office;
•	 Are responsible for identifying and/or managing the risks of an initiative (portfolio, program, or 
project);
•	 Teach or study risk management; and
•	 Are involved in any aspect of the project value delivery chain.
1.4 Principles of Risk Management
The seven principles outlined in Sections 1.4.1 through 1.4.7 guide the risk management process 
and are integral to effective risk management. They are:
•	 1.4.1 Strive to Achieve Excellence in the Practice of Risk Management
•	 1.4.2 Align Risk Management with Organizational Strategy, Governance Practices, and Project 
Management Performance Domains
•	 1.4.3 Focus on the Higher Risk Value
•	 1.4.4 Optimize Risk Responses to Focus on Value Realization
•	 1.4.5 Foster a Culture That Embraces Risk Management
•	 1.4.6 Navigate Complexity Using Risk Management to Enable Successful Outcomes and Value 
Realization
•	 1.4.7 Continuously Improve Risk Management Competencies
1.4.1 Strive to Achieve Excellence in the Practice of Risk Management
Risk management allows organizations and teams to increase the predictability of outcomes, both 
qualitatively and quantitatively, and improves the delivery of value supporting the organization’s 
strategy. This principle is about reaching the appropriate level of organizational process maturity 
(the ability of an organization to apply a certain set of processes in a consistent manner) and the 
optimal level of performance. Excellence in risk management is not achieved by the strict and

exhaustive application of related processes. Rather, it can be attained by (a) balancing the benefits 
to be obtained with the associated cost and (b) tailoring the risk management processes to the 
characteristics of the organization and its portfolios, programs, and projects. Process excellence in 
risk management is itself a risk management strategy.
Effective and appropriate risk management can reduce individual and overall threats while 
increasing individual and overall opportunities in a portfolio, program, project, or operation.
1.4.2 Align Risk Management with Organizational Strategy, Governance 
Practices, and Project Management Performance Domains
The practice of risk management in organizations is developed and evolved in coexistence 
with other organizational processes such as strategy and governance. The nature of portfolios, 
programs, and projects is such that circumstances may change frequently. Adaptability, agility, 
and resiliency are critical in risk management in order to respond to changing conditions and 
recover quickly from a setback or failure. Adjustments become necessary as the organization 
evolves (e.g., when changes to decision-making processes, timing, scope, and speed are made). 
The varying types of adjustments to risk management practices will be informed by the ongoing 
evaluation of the exposure to risk whenever these changes are implemented as recommended 
by the project management principle of optimizing risk responses. Establishing an appropriate 
cadence of risk reviews and feedback sessions with stakeholders is helpful for navigating project 
risk and being proactive with risk responses. Risk management interacts with the Stakeholders, 
Team, Development Approach and Life Cycle, Planning, Project Work, Delivery, Measurement, and 
Uncertainty project management performance domains, so successful risk management should be 
built seamlessly into these activities.
1.4.3 Focus on the Higher Risk Value
Successful organizations are able to effectively and efficiently identify and respond to the risks that 
directly influence goals and objectives. The challenge for most organizations is making the best use 
of resources by focusing on the right risks. This depends on the characteristics of the organization 
and its environment, internal maturity, culture, and organizational strategy. Determining the most 
impactful risks can be difficult. Organizations iteratively develop and improve their ability by 
refining the processes for risk prioritization. Organizations should also strengthen their capacity 
to anticipate threats and opportunities; maintain an acute awareness of the environment in which 
their project is implemented; and constantly monitor changes in the technical, social, political, 
market, and economic environments, as recommended in the Uncertainty project management 
performance domain.
1.4.4 Optimize Risk Responses to Focus on Value Realization
Risk management seeks to find the right balance among risk exposure, the cost of managing 
the risk, and the expected creation or realization of business value. Risk responses should be 
appropriate for the significance of the risk. The risk responses should be aligned to a planned 
strategy to achieve the desired value. Organizations should strike a comprehensive balance among 
the risk exposure and the potential costs and benefits of the portfolios, programs, and projects, and 
then make provisions for contingency reserves and buffers, thus securing the means to effectively 
respond to a risk if it materializes.

Introduction
1.4.5 Foster a Culture That Embraces Risk Management
Risk management is an inherent and essential part of the portfolio, program, and project 
management framework. The practice of risk management is propagated, recognized, and 
encouraged throughout the organization. A culture of risk management encourages (a) the 
proactive identification of threats and (b) the identification of opportunities by cultivating a 
positive mindset within the organization—one that is more open to accepting and harnessing the 
positive innovations and changes impacting the various initiatives. It is important to identify the 
organizational culture, the behavior of the project management team, and environmental factors 
to begin implementing a risk management culture across functions or areas of the organization. 
Risk management should be integrated as part of the project management team’s culture by 
deliberately including it within team norms, as well as by modeling risk management practices 
through the behaviors and actions of project team management.
1.4.6 Navigate Complexity Using Risk Management to  
Enable Successful Outcomes and Value Realization
Managing risk is critical to navigating, and even reducing, complexity and uncertainty within 
organizational initiatives. It is not an easy task as complexity is the result of human behavior, 
system interactions, uncertainty, rapid changes in the environment, technological innovation, and 
ambiguity. Yet, the ability to identify and manage risk depends directly on the type and level of 
complexity within an initiative.
Take project complexity, for example, which is the culmination of a multitude of individual elements 
that work toward a common goal within a portfolio, program, or project. It can be effectively 
controlled through risk management by clarifying the objectives, requirements, and scope of 
a particular initiative; identifying potential risks; and creating a plan to address such risks, thus 
reducing the possibility of unforeseen complexities that may be hindering the initiative.
In fact, the more organizations navigate complexity using risk management, the more effectively 
they can optimize the use of resources, increase returns on investment, and improve overall 
performance and business results. A strong focus on risk management can lay the groundwork for 
attaining success and valuable outcomes.
1.4.7 Continuously Improve Risk Management Competencies
The nature of risks to which an organization is exposed—and the available technology to manage 
those risks—is changing. Technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning 
(ML), allows organizations to manage risks more effectively and better focus on their impacts. 
By continuously improving risk management competencies, a team can bolster its ability to 
anticipate threats and opportunities, understand the consequences of issues, and balance the 
risk, responding to any associated costs and its value realization systematically. This will allow the 
team to:
•	 Maximize the probability of positive risks. If a positive risk occurs, it may provide an opportunity 
that could lead to benefits, such as reduced time, costs, or effort; and
•	 Decrease exposure to negative risks to avoid issues, such as delays, cost overruns, loss of 
reputation, or any other threats that may harm the organization.
Consequently, the team can become more proficient and efficient in its risk management approach.

Context and Key Concepts of Risk Management

Context and Key Concepts of  
Risk Management
Risk is inherently present in all organizations. While it presents challenges, it may also offer a 
competitive advantage when both threats and opportunities are managed proactively. Risk 
management provides a comprehensive, integrated framework for addressing and managing risk at 
all levels of the organization, from portfolios through programs, projects, and operations. Stakeholders 
should proactively identify risks throughout the portfolio, program, project, and organization to 
eliminate or minimize the impacts of threats as well as maximize the impact of opportunities.
In today’s dynamic and interconnected world, businesses face a wide range of risks, including 
technological, regulatory, market, and competitive risks. Other risks could be because of increased 
globalization that can expose organizations to risks originating from different parts of the world, 
thus necessitating a more holistic, integrated approach to risk management.
Furthermore, regulatory requirements related to risk management have become more stringent, 
requiring organizations to implement robust risk management processes to ensure compliance and 
avoid penalties.
The pace of change in business environments, driven by technological advancements and changing 
consumer preferences, has made it more challenging for organizations to anticipate and respond to 
risks effectively.
2.1 Key Concepts and Definitions
All organizations face uncertainties with both internal and external events. Uncertain challenges 
may be dealt with by formulating and applying a sound business strategy focused on realizing a 
set of objectives and managing risks. Risk management provides insight into risks that need to be 
addressed in support of reaching those objectives, while also taking advantage of opportunities. 
When such opportunities occur, they are called benefits; when negative risks or threats occur, 
they are called issues. If the overall threats or issues to the portfolio, program, or project are 
too high, the organization may choose to cancel the effort.
2.1.1 Risk
An individual risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect 
on one or more objectives.
For example, a positive risk is a potential upcoming change in policy that could benefit a project. 
A negative risk can be an unanticipated increase of labor or material cost, which may cause the 
project to surpass the original budget. In this case, the problem becomes more specific, with a 
causal factor, instead of just stating that the project will be over budget. Overall risk is the impact 
of uncertainty that affects organizational objectives at different levels or aspects.
Risks can arise from all sources of uncertainty and assumptions, including individual risks at the 
portfolio, program, and project levels. These risks represent the exposure of the organization and its 
stakeholders to the consequences of uncertainty regarding the organization’s strategy and business 
objectives. Once a risk occurs, it is then managed within the various governance layers (enterprise, 
portfolio, program, and project) by driving the resulting outcomes.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
Uncertainty is inherent to the nature of portfolios, programs, and projects. Uncertainty refers to 
a lack of comprehension or awareness regarding issues, events, or potential solutions. It involves 
assessing probabilities of various actions, reactions, and outcomes. Uncertainty encompasses 
unknown-unknowns and black swans, representing emerging factors beyond current knowledge 
or experience.
Risk both arises out of uncertainty and generates uncertainty through a lack of awareness about 
potential outcomes or the likelihood of occurrence. Thus, the more risks one can identify, the 
better one can plan and prepare for them. Some of the key factors determining the ability to 
identify risks include ambiguity and uncertainty, which is a state of being unclear, of not knowing 
what to expect or how to comprehend a situation, or continuously evaluating the common sources 
of complexity, as explained in the PMBOK® Guide [2]. When ambiguity is low, the level of integral 
information is sufficient, and there is clarity and a high degree of certainty in terms of what to 
expect, which allows for the identification of risks. Though complexity cannot be controlled, 
project teams can modify their activities to control and address impacts that occur as a result of 
complexity, as described in the PMBOK® Guide [2]. When it comes to uncertainty and ambiguity, 
assessment and open evaluation drive risk management efforts. All initiatives, including portfolios, 
programs, and projects, possess risks since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of 
uncertainty.
Assessments and open evaluations help determine the right risk management strategy as well 
as how risks will be handled across the entire portfolio, program, and project management life 
cycles, including their various stages and interactions. Open evaluation in risk management 
refers to the transparent and inclusive assessment of risks, and involves actively involving 
stakeholders, experts, and relevant parties in the evaluation process to gather diverse 
perspectives and insights.
Establishing a frequent synchronization, rhythm, cadence, or schedule of review-and-feedback 
sessions (e.g., weekly, biweekly, monthly, etc.) for team members and stakeholders is helpful for 
navigating risks and being proactive with risk management. In projects following an adaptive 
approach, if used by the team, a daily meeting (e.g., daily standup meetings) can be instrumental 
in identifying potential risks. During such meetings, potential obstacles or impediments can be 
identified, thus reducing the likelihood of these becoming issues.
A SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis can help with risk assessment, 
enabling a team to identify risks in a portfolio, program, or project. SWOT analysis evaluates 
initiatives from each of the SWOT perspectives, identifies and lists organizational strengths and 
weaknesses, and then derives opportunities from both the strengths and the threats from those 
weaknesses. Below are examples of how this approach can be carried out.
2.1.1.1 Strengths
Strengths are characteristics that give an organization a competitive advantage over others and 
contribute to the success of portfolios, programs, and projects. This is accomplished by:
•	 Identifying portfolios, programs, or projects in trouble more easily;
•	 Minimizing surprises;
•	 Providing better-quality data for decision-making;
•	 Enhancing communication; and
•	 Improving budget estimates.

Context and Key Concepts of Risk Management
2.1.1.2 Weaknesses
Weaknesses place an organization at a disadvantage and negatively impact the success of 
portfolios, programs, and projects. Examples include:
•	 Exorbitant training costs,
•	 Loss of focus due to automation, and
•	 Data security issues.
2.1.1.3 Opportunities
Opportunities are risks that would have a positive effect on one or more project objectives. 
Opportunity management helps to point out and understand the possible ways in which objectives 
can be achieved more successfully.
Moving beyond the traditional view of risk as a value destroyer to seeing it as a potential value 
enhancer requires creativity and vision, and may help organizations to develop a system for 
allowing these opportunities to flourish and result in organizational success.
A consistent portfolio, program, and project management system helps to:
•	 Identify and assess opportunities that are often linked, and
•	 Improve the organization’s ability to accept and pursue opportunities.
Risk responses should be developed for the opportunities and should be reviewed to see whether 
the planned responses may have introduced any secondary risks.
2.1.1.4 Threats
Threats are risks that would have a negative effect on one or more project objectives. Threat 
management specifically focuses on addressing potential negative events or threats, and is a subset 
of risk management. It involves the use of risk management resources to:
•	 Describe risks;
•	 Analyze risk attributes (e.g., specific characteristics or qualities associated with risks);
•	 Evaluate the probability of risk occurrence and impacts, as well as other characteristics; and
•	 Implement a planned response, when appropriate.
A response to a specific threat may include multiple strategies. If the threat cannot be avoided, it 
may be mitigated to a level where it becomes viable to transfer or to accept it and respond in such a 
way that the project is not negatively affected. Creating a contingency reserve will support the risk 
response strategies by ensuring sufficient funds are set aside in the event of a risk being identified 
or other applicable events (e.g., supply chain issues or budget overruns).
Similar to managing opportunities, handling threats is a staged process. Both use a structured life 
cycle framework to ensure the process is robust and complete, as described in Section 4. Should 
threats occur, they are called issues and are listed in the issue log.
2.1.2 Risk Attitude
Risk attitude is a disposition toward uncertainty, adopted explicitly or implicitly by individuals and 
groups, driven by perception and previous personal experience, and evidenced by observable 
behavior. Risk attitude represents an organization’s approach to assessing and eventually pursuing,

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
retaining, taking, or turning away from risk. It is a function of risk appetite and risk threshold and can 
range from risk averse to risk seeking.
Organizations seek to establish a consistent method for evaluating and responding to risk across the 
enterprise. One obstacle to developing that consistency is an individual’s different or inconsistent 
attitudes toward risks—and those attitudes may vary according to the circumstance.
However, organizations can choose to change the risk attitudes of individuals and groups by providing 
them with tools and techniques they can use to learn how to assess each situation and then consciously 
choose a risk attitude explicitly. This empowers them to select the attitude most appropriate to the 
situation and offers the best chance of achieving portfolio, program, and project objectives.
In summary, risk attitude is an individual or group preference when evaluating a risk situation in a 
favorable or unfavorable way and then acting accordingly. While risk attitudes are not necessarily 
stable or homogeneous, organizations can adopt tools and techniques designed to coach and 
mentor staff on how to change their risk attitudes. It is important to identify and assess the level of 
adaptability and resiliency of the organization. Adaptability is the ability to respond to changing 
conditions, and resiliency is the ability to absorb impacts and recover quickly from a setback or 
failure. The risk attitude will reflect the level of adaptability and resiliency of the team.
2.1.3 Risk Appetite
Risk appetite is how much uncertainty an organization is okay with while pursuing its goals. It’s 
about finding a middle ground between being open to taking risks and being cautious. Other 
elements that complement the appetite for risk include risk tolerance and risk capacity.
A risk appetite determination represents the start of embracing risk. Figure 2-1 shows the 
interrelationship of risk appetite and its direct influence on business strategy, the risk management 
framework, and the underlying organizational policies and processes. The resulting risk appetite 
determination defines the amount and type of risk that the organization is willing to accept in order 
to meet its strategic objectives.

11
Context and Key Concepts of Risk Management
Additionally, risk appetite expresses the level of risk the organization is willing to take in pursuit of 
its portfolio, program, and project objectives. Portfolio, program, and project risk is a multifaceted 
rather than singular concept.
As organizations grow, expand, and evolve, so do the risks they face. The type, prominence, and 
appetite for risks may change at different points in the life cycle of an organization and during the 
life cycle of its portfolios, programs, and projects.
The risk appetite of an organization should take into consideration some of the more common 
sources of complexity, such as:
•	 Human behavior. The interplay of conduct, demeanors, attitudes, and experiences of people 
that influence risk attitude and risk appetite.
•	 System behavior. The result of dynamic interdependencies within and among project 
elements.
•	 Uncertainty and ambiguity. A state of being unclear, of not knowing what to expect or how 
to comprehend a situation.
•	 Technological innovation. New technology, along with the uncertainty of how that 
technology will be used, contributes to complexity.
These sources of complexity could impact the risk appetite of an organization, project team, 
or individual person. It is important to take into consideration these common sources of 
complexity to understand the variance of risk appetites among organizations, project teams, or 
individual persons.
2.1.4 Risk Threshold
Risk threshold is the measure of acceptable variation around an objective that reflects the risk 
appetite of the organization and its stakeholders. A key element of risk strategy is the establishment 
and monitoring of enterprise, portfolio, program, and project risk thresholds. Risk threshold 
thus represents the level of risk below which an organization will accept, and above which an 
organization will not accept.
Examples of risk thresholds include:
•	 Minimum level of risk exposure for a risk to be included in the risk register,
•	 Qualitative or quantitative definitions of risk rating, and
•	 Maximum level of risk exposure that can be managed before an escalation is triggered.
A project manager conducts a qualitative analysis of identified risks, prioritizes them based on their 
probability of occurrence and impact, and establishes risk response plans. Consider a software 
development project aiming to create a new mobile application. In qualitative risk analysis, the 
project team and stakeholders identify potential risks related to the project’s objectives, timeline, 
resources, and technology. Some identified risks could include integrating new technologies or 
platforms that the team is not familiar with, which could lead to delays or errors in development.
For data to be suitable for quantitative risk analysis, it should be studied for a long period of time or 
observed in multiple situations.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
Establishing risk thresholds is an integral step in linking portfolio, program, and project risk 
management to strategy alignment. This is performed as part of the definition of risk policies in 
the organization or, if common definitions do not exist, as part of the project definition before 
including it in the portfolio. Based on the risk appetite of the organization, governance may also 
be responsible for ensuring risk thresholds are established and observed, and for deciding when a 
risk should be escalated to a higher governance level. Making use of technological advances and 
emergent technologies such as artificial intelligence, organizations can automate the determination 
of when risk thresholds are reached and put in place predetermined workflows that include 
escalation to higher governance levels when risk thresholds are exceeded.
The risk threshold reflects the risk appetite. Therefore, a risk threshold of ±5% around a cost 
objective reflects a lower risk appetite than a risk threshold of ±10%. The risk appetite and risk 
threshold inform how the project team and other stakeholders navigate risk in a project.
2.1.5 Uncertainty
Uncertainty is directly related to risk and it stems from a lack of understanding and awareness of 
issues, events, paths to follow, or solutions to pursue. Broadly, it refers to a state of not knowing 
or unpredictability. According to the PMBOK® Guide [2], successful navigation of uncertainty starts 
with an understanding of the larger environment in which the organization operates. Options for 
responding to uncertainty may include:
•	 Gathering more information,
•	 Preparing for multiple outcomes,
•	 Set-based design, and
•	 Building in resilience.
2.2 Risk Management in Organizations
The organization’s governance body is ultimately responsible for setting, confirming, and enforcing 
risk appetite and risk management principles as part of its governance oversight. An organization’s 
governance also determines which risk management processes are appropriate in terms of 
organizational strategy, scope, context, and content.
The enterprise risk function often resides in the executive management organization due to the 
direct relationship between the success of achieving organizational strategic goals and employing 
an effective risk management process.
When assessing the seriousness of a risk or combination of risks, uncertainty and its effect on 
endeavors or objectives are considered. The uncertainty dimension is commonly described as 
probability and the effect is often referred to as impact.
The definition of risk includes both (a) distinct events that are uncertain but can be clearly described 
and (b) more general conditions that are less specific but may also give rise to uncertainty.
The definition of risk also encompasses uncertain events that could have a negative or positive 
effect on objectives. Both of these uncertain situations are considered to be risks when they could 
have an adverse or positive effect on the achievement of objectives. It is essential to address 
both situations within an enterprise, portfolio, program, or project risk management process.

Context and Key Concepts of Risk Management
Addressing threats and opportunities together (i.e., addressing both in the same analysis and 
coordinating the responses to both when they overlap) allows for synergies and efficiencies.
It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features. Causes are events or circumstances 
that currently exist or are certain to exist in the future, which may give rise to risks. Effects are 
conditional future events or conditions that directly affect one or more objectives if the associated 
risk occurs.
A risk may have one or more causes and, if it occurs, may have one or more effects. When a 
risk event happens, the risk ceases to be uncertain. Threats that occur are termed issues, and 
opportunities that occur are benefits to the enterprise, portfolio, program, or project. Portfolio, 
program, and project managers are responsible for resolving these issues and managing them 
efficiently and effectively. Issues may entail actions that are outside the scope of the portfolio, 
program, and project risk management processes, or above the ability of a certain manager; 
therefore, these issues are escalated to a higher management level according to the organization’s 
governance policy.
2.3 Risk Management at Different Organizational Levels
Risk management is an integrated framework that spans organizational levels. Aside from simply 
predicting what could happen, the aim of risk management is to develop the means to support the 
achievement of organizational objectives, realization of the strategic vision, and creation of value.
Risk management strongly influences decision-making at the enterprise, portfolio, program, 
project, and product levels. Product management considerations are applicable to projects where 
the deliverables are products; these fall outside of the scope of this document. At the enterprise 
level, the entire organizational strategy is the set of strategic and business management actions for 
countering business threats and exploiting business opportunities. These decisions and actions are 
often executed within the portfolio as part of its individual components.
The various perceptions and perspectives regarding risk management at the portfolio, program, and 
project management levels feed into one another in an iterative, interactive, and dynamic manner. 
Risks may be interconnected, have dependencies, and interact via feedback loops (see Figure 2-2). 
Details of these interactions are provided in Sections 5, 6, and 7.
2.3.1 Enterprise
The primary purpose of risk management is the creation and protection of value. Enterprise risk 
management (ERM) is an approach for identifying major risks that confront an organization as 
well as forecasting the significance of those risks to business processes. The way in which risks are 
managed reflects the organization’s culture, capability, and strategy to create and sustain value. ERM 
addresses risks at the organizational level, including the aggregation of all risks associated with the 
enterprise’s portfolio of programs and projects.
When exploring alternative strategies, ERM enables the alignment of each portfolio, program, 
and project component with the organizational strategy. ERM establishes the connections among 
the various governance levels through the bottom-up escalation of identified risks and the top-
down definition of risk management strategies. The top-down process triggers the creation of 
programs, projects, and other activities aimed at exploiting specific opportunities and addressing 
business threats.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
ERM provides a systematic, organized, and structured method for:
•	 Identifying and assessing the key risks an organization faces,
•	 Developing suitable responses,
•	 Communicating status with stakeholders, and
•	 Assigning responsibility for monitoring and managing risks in alignment with the strategic 
objectives of the organization.
ERM is an ongoing process that supports the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle for continuous 
improvement. ERM is not limited to compliance and disclosure requirements, nor is it a replacement 
for internal controls and audits. The application of ERM varies depending on the organization 
and could change from year to year based on overall risk appetite, stakeholder expectations and 
requirements, and the internal and external environment.
There is no one-size-fits-all approach to performing ERM. Its function, structure, and activities vary 
with each organization. ERM ensures that all key organizational risks are addressed and properly 
managed and monitored, and that a culture of effective risk management is established and 
cascaded down to the portfolio, program, and project levels.

Context and Key Concepts of Risk Management
Risk management in the enterprise management context of integrated portfolio, program, and 
project management consists of:
•	 Elaborating the risk governance framework;
•	 Identifying operational and contextual risks at each level of the integrated governance 
framework, including both negative risks (threats) and positive risks (opportunities);
•	 Analyzing the identified risks from both the qualitative and quantitative perspectives and 
identifying the governance layer best suited to manage them, according to the escalation rules 
in place within the portfolio, program, and project management framework;
•	 Defining an appropriate risk management strategy based on increasing the probability and/or 
impact of positive risks (opportunities) and decreasing the probability and/or impact of negative 
risks (threats);
•	 Identifying the risk owner and assigning the risk;
•	 Implementing the corresponding strategies and activities related to anticipatory and/or 
responsive actions;
•	 Monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of the risk management strategies deployed within 
the enterprise, portfolio, program, and project management framework;
•	 Ensuring alignment among portfolio, program, and project management risk governance 
models and the ERM strategy; and
•	 Promoting effective risk management within the entire enterprise through a risk management 
culture.
2.3.2 Portfolio
Portfolio risk management categorizes risks as structural, component, and overall risks. Structural 
risks are associated with the composition of a group of projects and the potential interdependencies 
among components. Component risks at the portfolio level are those the component manager 
escalates to the portfolio level for information or action. Overall, portfolio risk considers the 
interdependencies among components and is therefore more than just the sum of individual 
component risks. Risk efficiency is a key element of managing risk at the portfolio level. Risk 
efficiency is achieved by adjusting the mix of portfolio components to balance risk and reward so 
that overall portfolio risk exposure is managed.
Planning, designing, and implementing an effective portfolio risk management system depends 
on organizational culture, top management commitment, stakeholder engagement, and open 
and fair communication processes. Portfolio risk management is important for the success of 
managing portfolios where the value lost due to component failure is significant, or when the risks 
of one component impact the risks in another component. One of the purposes of portfolio risk 
management is to meet the strategic plan and achieve organizational goals and objectives.
As defined in The Standard for Portfolio Management [3], portfolio risk management ensures that 
components achieve the best possible success based on the organizational strategy and business 
model. Portfolio risk management can be viewed as the management activities related to adapting 
the mix of portfolio components to the evolution of the organization’s business environment. 
Similar to enterprise strategy, the result of portfolio risk management strategy is defining and 
launching new components or closing other ones. Portfolio components can be responses to 
identified threats or opportunities in alignment with the organization’s overall business strategy.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
Portfolio risk management involves the identification and balancing of risk factors (environmental, 
human, legislation, compliance, etc.) to effectively and efficiently enable portfolio value delivery. 
A risk factor refers to any variable, condition, or circumstance that increases the likelihood of a 
negative event occurring or the severity of its impact. In various contexts, risk factors are elements 
that contribute to uncertainty, a potential threat, or an opportunity.
Managing risk at all levels is an active process involving continuous planning, analysis, response, 
and monitoring and control. A desired outcome from portfolio risk management is utilizing 
a structured risk-planning-and-response effort in order to reduce management inaction and 
decision delay. Risk not addressed at the portfolio level could be addressed through governance 
processes at the strategic level. In the final analysis, if a risk becomes an issue, it may be handled 
through the organization’s portfolio, program, and project structure and not at the strategic 
governance level.
Risk management plays a significant role in decision-making processes—and has the capability 
to affect decision-making timeframes and activities. For example, identifying potential risks can 
lead the team to consider factors they might have otherwise overlooked, which can influence the 
timeframe and activities involved. It can also prompt the team to adjust their timelines or activities 
to respond (i.e., mitigate or avoid certain risks altogether). In addition, risk management doesn’t 
stop once a decision is made. It involves ongoing monitoring and review of risks to ensure that the 
decision remains viable.
Risk management involves a comprehensive process of identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and 
responding to risks, including escalation to higher levels of management (i.e., program and portfolio 
levels) as necessary. In many cases, decisions regarding resource allocation, project prioritization, 
and strategic planning are informed by risk assessments and considerations.
2.3.3 Program
Program risk management strategy ensures effective management of any risk that can cause 
misalignment between the program roadmap and its supported objectives to organizational 
strategy. It includes defining program risk thresholds, performing the initial program risk 
assessment, and developing a program risk response strategy.
Program risk management determines how risks are to be communicated to governance layers 
and strategic levels of the organization. This level of strategic alignment requires that program risk 
thresholds take into account the organizational strategy and risk attitude. Program risks go beyond 
the sum of the risks from each project within the program. Program risk management applies the 
concepts of portfolio risk management to the set of program components.
The Standard for Program Management [4] describes program risk management strategy as:
•	 Identifying program risk thresholds,
•	 Performing an initial program risk assessment,
•	 Developing a high-level program risk response strategy, and
•	 Determining how risks are to be communicated and managed as part of governance.
Program risk management aggregates operational risks for component projects and activities and 
handles the specific risks at the program level, which is dependent on the layers of accountability 
defined in the portfolio, program, and project governance models. Also, the perspective on risk

Context and Key Concepts of Risk Management
at the program level is, in many cases, more focused on the immediate impact of threats than on the 
expected benefit of achieving opportunities.
A program risk is an event or series of events or conditions that may affect the success of 
the program. These risks arise from the program components and their interactions with 
one another; from technical complexity, schedule, or cost constraints; and from the broader 
environment in which the program is managed. Two aspects of risk should be assessed during 
program definition: (a) an identification of the key risks that the program may encounter and 
(b) an assessment of the organization’s willingness to accept and deal with risks, sometimes 
referred to as its risk appetite.
2.3.4 Project
Project risk management is addressed in the Uncertainty project management performance domain 
that comprises activities and functions associated with risk and uncertainty that could impact cost, 
schedule, or scope baselines.
The PMBOK® Guide [2] embeds project risk management as part of the system for value delivery 
for an organization by including it as one of the principles of project management—Optimize Risk 
Responses—and as a project management performance domain—Uncertainty. This ensures that 
project risk management is part of the value chain that links those and other business capabilities to 
advancing organizational strategy, value, and business objectives.
Risk management steps include the processes of conducting risk management planning, 
identification, analysis, response planning, response implementation, and monitoring risks of a 
project. The objectives of project risk management are to increase the probability and/or impact of 
opportunities and decrease those of threats, in order to increase the chances of project success. The 
PMBOK® Guide [2] states that when unmanaged, these risks have the potential to cause the project 
to deviate from the plan and fail to achieve the defined project objectives. Consequently, project 
success is directly related to the effectiveness of project risk management.
Project risk management supports project objectives by adapting or implementing the courses of 
action and project activities to take advantage of emerging changes in the project environment. 
Thus, the project baselines (e.g., scope, schedule, and cost) are risk informed. All identified risks 
undergo qualitative analysis, and some risks undergo quantitative analysis when the risk impacts 
the baseline and/or when analysis of the combined effect of multiple risks is required.
The PMBOK® Guide [2] states that team members should evaluate exposure to risks, both 
opportunities and threats, on an ongoing basis to maximize positive impacts and minimize 
negative impacts to the project and its outcomes. The risk responses should be appropriate for 
the significance of the risk, effective and realistic within the project context, agreed upon by 
stakeholders, and owned by an accountable person.
2.4 Key Success Factors
Enterprise (which includes organizational project management), portfolio, program, and project 
risk management are conducted in a manner consistent with practices and policies. In addition, 
portfolio, program, and project risk management are performed in a way that is appropriate to the 
characteristics of the endeavor. Specific criteria for the success of each risk management process are 
listed in the sections dealing with those processes. The key success factors for risk management that 
enable the realization of the principles are illustrated in Figure 2-3.

The key success factors include:
•	 Recognizing the value of risk management. Portfolio, program, and project risk 
management are recognized by organizational management, stakeholders, and team members 
as valuable disciplines providing a positive return on investment.
•	 Individual commitment/responsibility. Portfolio, program, and project participants 
and stakeholders accept responsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk 
management is everyone’s responsibility.
•	 Open and honest communication. Everyone is involved in the risk management process. 
Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about risk reduce the effectiveness of risk 
management regarding proactive approaches and effective decision-making. It is important for 
project members to hone their power skills, such as collaborative leadership, communication, 
an innovative mindset, for-purpose orientation, and empathy, to ensure they can have open and 
honest communication with one another and their stakeholders.

Context and Key Concepts of Risk Management
•	 Organizational commitment. Organizational commitment is established only when 
risk management is aligned with the organization’s goals, values, and ERM policies. Risk 
management actions may require the approval of, or response from, others at levels above the 
portfolio, program, or project manager.
•	 Tailoring risk effort. Risk management activities are consistent with the value of 
the endeavor to the organization and with its levels of risk, complexity, scale, and other 
organizational constraints (e.g., insufficient information, equipment interruptions, or inadequate 
help from other people).
•	 Integration with organizational project management. Risk management does not exist 
in a vacuum isolated from other organizational project management processes. Successful risk 
management requires the appropriate execution of organizational project management and 
ERM processes, including the allocation of resources necessary for the effective application of 
risk management.

Framework for Risk Management  
in Portfolio, Program, and  
Project Management
Risks are present in every organizational activity, especially across endeavors such as portfolios, 
programs, and projects. Organizational inertia is inherently risky because products and services 
become stale over time and organizations may lose their competitiveness due to societal and 
technological changes. Risks can be difficult to manage because even one can have different impacts 
on various components of portfolios and programs and across the various levels of an organization. 
Thus, risks should be handled through the organization’s portfolio, program, and project structures.
Organizations and professionals need to balance threats and opportunities and the dilemma of 
inaction versus action. This section addresses this dilemma by providing the framework for risk 
management across the enterprise and its portfolio, program, and project management activities. 
An effective framework for risk management should cover the areas of risk identification, analysis, 
measurement, response, reporting and monitoring, and governance. Ideally, this framework should 
be flexible enough to be tailored to any organization’s portfolio, program, and project context, thus 
ensuring positive outcomes consistently.
3.1 Business Context of Risk Management in  
Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
All organizations encounter internal and external factors that influence their ability to achieve 
desired objectives, because all organizational activities involve uncertainty and risks.
An organization manages risk through people, processes, technology, and information. Portfolio, 
program, and project managers are responsible for risks associated with their endeavors. These 
managers should work with stakeholders at various levels of the organization; apply a systematic, 
integrated approach to risk management; and ensure that the portfolio, programs, projects, 
products, and operations work together to create value for the organization. Policies, procedures, 
approaches, frameworks, and the governance structure, among other factors, should be taken into 
consideration as part of risk management.
Figure 3-1 represents the context of organizational activities, from the abstract (the top of an 
organization) to the specific (the bottom), where discrete tasks are completed. Risk permeates 
throughout the pyramid. For greater context, see how Figure 3-1 illustrates how the organizational 
strategy sets the direction for the vision and mission, and defines specific objectives for the 
organization. This is all-encompassing and includes operational and change activities.
Goals and objectives are aligned with strategies. The attainment of business benefits and value 
requires the execution of operational and change management plans. Organizations realize the 
benefits of change by executing plans and their associated activities, which result in the successful 
attainment of portfolio, program, and project objectives. Change by its very nature can cause 
uncertainty. For most organizations, change is inevitable and necessary to maintain and sustain 
competitiveness. To manage change successfully, organizations require a robust, well-considered 
strategic execution plan to implement portfolios, programs, and projects in a consistent manner 
over time (see Figure 3-2). This requires the adoption of an effective organizational project 
management implementation.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
Organizational project management is a framework in which portfolio, program, and project 
management are aligned with strategy and integrated with organizational enablers to achieve 
strategic objectives. Portfolio, program, and project management target business objectives that 
support the organizational strategy. Linking portfolio management to strategy balances the use 
of resources to maximize the value delivered in executing programs, projects, and operational 
activities, as described in The Standard for Portfolio Management [3]. Some threats arise when 
strategy or business objectives are not aligned with the organization’s mission, vision, and core 
values. Additional threats arise when business models and objectives do not support strategy or 
when endeavors, such as portfolios, programs, and projects, are not aligned with the business 
models and objectives. Opportunities could be enhanced when strategy and business models and 
objectives are well aligned. The strategy and business models and objectives should be evaluated 
constantly because the cadence of project deliverables could impact the program and portfolio.

Framework for Risk Management in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
enterprise risk management (ERM) is an approach to identifying and managing risk that reflects the 
organization’s culture, capability, and strategy to create and sustain value. ERM covers the policies, 
processes, and methods by which organizations manage risks (both threats and opportunities) to 
advance the mission and vision of the organization and create value. Portfolio risk management 
derives its policies, processes, methods, and risk thresholds from the ERM framework and tailors 
it for the management of portfolios. Similarly, programs and projects adopt their respective risk 
management practices from the portfolio framework.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
The governance board has a fiduciary responsibility to oversee ERM and ensure that a risk 
management strategy is in place. Portfolio, program, and project managers have the responsibility 
to implement the risk management strategy by ensuring risk management processes are in place 
and risk responses are optimized. These managers should also ensure risk responses are appropriate 
for the significance of the risk, cost effective, realistic within the project parameters, agreed upon 
by relevant stakeholders, and owned by a responsible person, as explained in the PMBOK® Guide [2]. 
This approach will help instill the importance and values of risk management, expected culture and 
behavior, and risk attitude.
3.1.2 Organizational Context
The application of ERM is influenced by industry shifts, regulations, disruptive technology, 
competition, business model changes, and organizational context. By understanding the context 
in which the organization exists, portfolio, program, and project managers can tailor the optimal 
approach to risk management for their endeavors and simultaneously assist the organization in 
assessing and responding to risks. Many factors can also impact the extent of risk management 
practices, including legal, economic, and behavioral factors; human health; and the effects of each 
decision/alternative. It is important to take into consideration the organizational culture and style 
(distinctive characteristics) when the portfolio, program, and project managers start evaluating 
these factors.
3.1.3 Strategic and Organizational Planning
Risk management in portfolios, programs, and projects aligns with setting the strategic vision, 
mission, goals, values, and business models and objectives of an organization, always focusing 
on value realization. It provides the inputs for pursuing different alternatives. Strategic goals and 
business models and objectives are developed to realize the organization’s vision and mission in line 
with core values. Once these goals and objectives are set, they become inputs for risk management. 
If there are potential conflicts between strategic goals and the portfolio of work, then the risk is 
escalated to the appropriate level of management, namely ERM; portfolios, programs, and projects; 
or operations, as depicted in Figure 3.3.
3.1.4 Linking Planning with Execution through  
Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
Portfolio, program, and project management refer to different levels in the organizational project 
management (OPM) framework for managing capabilities and enhancing existing value or 
creating new value. A larger portfolio can contain subsidiary portfolios, which in themselves are 
component collections of programs, projects, or operations managed as groups to achieve strategic 
objectives. It is thus easy to see why portfolio management serves as a bridge connecting strategic 
planning with business execution. By focusing on selecting the right portfolio components (e.g., 
programs, projects, and operational initiatives), portfolio management enables organizations to 
achieve alignment with strategy and to invest their resources in controlling risks based on their 
likelihood and impact. Portfolio, program, and project management are then responsible for the 
implementation of risk management strategies.
These activities are performed within an environment that is full of unexpected and harmful 
risks. While organizational project management enables an organization to leverage its results

Framework for Risk Management in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
and implementation success and supports a healthy organization within a competitive and 
rapidly changing environment, it is never risk free. Therefore, it is essential for organizational 
leaders and managers to recognize the importance of managing risks to reduce the impact of the 
threats and identify opportunities. This approach allows them to focus on developing an overall 
organizational orientation toward treating as many endeavors as appropriate and managing 
them individually and collectively in such a way as to support the organization’s strategic goals. 
Portfolio, program, and project managers work inclusively to (a) identify, analyze, evaluate, 
prioritize, recommend, plan, and implement risk responses; (b) monitor progress; and (c) adjust 
risk responses as appropriate.
3.2 Scope of Accountability, Responsibility, and Authority
The accountability, responsibility, and authority of risk management are shared by key stakeholders 
involved in enterprise, portfolio, program, and project management. Clarity on roles and 
responsibilities can improve team cultures; whenever tasks are delegated to individuals or selected 
by project team members, it is important to clarify the scope of the following:
•	 Accountability is individual by nature and derived from a position held in the organization. Unlike 
responsibility, accountability cannot be shared. Accountability is related to authority in that 
one is usually held accountable within one’s limits of authority. However, one still may be held 
accountable beyond one’s authority to act. Furthermore, in a collaborative project team, the 
team will take collective ownership of the project outcomes.
•	 Responsibility resides in an individual by the assignment of a function or task. By accepting 
the assignment, an individual takes on the associated responsibility. The fact that others 
higher in the organization may also be held responsible or accountable does not diminish the 
responsibility held by the individual. The assigning individual is still held accountable for the 
delegated task, but responsibility is passed to the assigned individual.
•	 Authority, like responsibility, may be delegated and gives an individual the ability to make 
decisions within defined bounds. Authority denotes accountability but needs to be combined 
with effective leadership to motivate a group toward a common goal, influence them to align 
their individual interests in favor of collective effort, and achieve success as a project team rather 
than as individuals, as described in the PMBOK® Guide [2].
3.2.1 Accountability at the Enterprise Level
The objective of risk management is to apply knowledge, skills, and good practices to manage 
the area of focus within the risk threshold that is acceptable to the organization, whether at 
the enterprise, portfolio, program, or project level. The purpose is to embrace opportunities 
that translate to value and minimize the impact of threats to protect the organization from loss. 
The management of risk across the continuum of portfolios, programs, and projects requires 
collaboration throughout the enterprise as well as the recognition that failure to allocate the 
appropriate amount of resources could jeopardize the organization’s strategic objectives. Effective 
risk management across the organization reduces threat exposure and the effects of uncertainty. 
An effective risk management approach will help with the accuracy of the planned allocation of risk 
contingency resources, increasing the project delivery reliability and the effect of project delivery 
execution on portfolio/program benefit realization.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
Portfolio, program, and project management are responsible for supporting management policies, 
defining roles and responsibilities, setting targets, and overseeing implementation. The managers 
of the work are responsible for keeping senior management and stakeholders apprised of ongoing 
risk exposure and corresponding responses, thus avoiding a lack of prioritization of portfolio risks, 
program risks, and project risks.
3.2.2 Accountability at the Portfolio Level
Portfolios can exist for brief periods of time or as long as the organization itself. As a result, 
portfolio managers may oversee activities or authorize components that could take several 
years for the organization to recognize as valuable investments. Any change in this landscape 
has direct implications on the organization’s strategic objectives. Specific external factors may 
include regulatory requirements or mandates, market conditions, supply chain disruptions, 
cyberattacks, geopolitical events, and environmental risks. The risk environment at the 
portfolio level is dynamic, complex, interdependent, and nonlinear, so change management 
should be implemented at the portfolio level to drive any changes and align the organization’s 
strategic objectives.
Portfolio risk management tackles strategic, execution, and structural risks. Whereas program 
risk management evaluates risk across a related set of components, portfolio risk management 
is broad and considers risks that could impact unrelated components and operational activities 
within the portfolio. As a result, portfolio managers address several challenges when managing 
risk because portfolio-level risks encompass both external and internal factors by bridging 
organizational strategy to implementation. Consequently, there is a distinction among portfolio 
management, program management, and project management. The portfolio manager should 
delegate risk response measures to subordinate programs or projects within the portfolio. 
Managing risks at all levels is an active process involving continuous planning, analysis, 
response, monitoring, and control—always focusing on the adaptability, resiliency, and context 
of the organization.
3.2.3 Accountability at the Program Level
At the program level, evaluated risks span the related components and, if triggered, could have 
a positive or negative impact on one or more other components. Working with the component 
managers, it is the responsibility of the program manager to identify and manage any risks that 
could cause the program to be out of alignment with organizational strategy or the business 
model and objectives. Rather than manage these risks individually within the component, program 
managers should ensure that program risks are managed through coordination.
When managing strategic risk, program managers may identify new risks that exceed the 
organization’s risk appetite and could directly impact the program. Strategic risks can present 
both threats and opportunities. Thus, the program manager evaluates and reviews a set of 
response options for consideration with the governance body. The program risk management 
strategy should include defining the risk thresholds applicable to the program- and component-
level risks, performing the initial program risk assessment, and developing a high-level program 
risk response strategy.
Within a program, risks can affect the delivery of specific components. As a result, the program 
managers advise their component managers of any shared risks and response plans that relate to

individual components. There may be economies of scale and scope in that the shared risks could 
be managed by initiating one risk response at the program level. The program manager should 
determine how the risk will be communicated to strategic levels of the organization, escalating the 
risk and issues appropriately within the program (component teams, program management team, 
program steering committee) and outside of it.
3.2.4 Accountability at the Project Level
At the project level, the objective of risk management is to (a) decrease the probability and impact 
of negative risks and (b) increase the probability and impact of positive risks specific to project 
deliverables or objectives. As defined in the PMBOK® Guide [2], the Uncertainty project management 
performance domain addresses activities and functions associated with risk and uncertainty. 
Project managers are accountable for evaluating, reporting, and managing both individual and 
overall project risks within the constraints of the project, proactively exploring and responding to 
uncertainty, anticipating threats and opportunities, and understanding the consequences of issues. 
The project managers may escalate certain risks to, or receive guidance from, sources such as the 
program manager, portfolio manager, project management office (PMO), governance board, and 
other leadership entities, depending on the complexity of the initiative and organizational inputs.
All project team members have responsibility for managing risks. These responsibilities could 
include the identification of risks, from initiation to closing; clarification of the trigger events; or 
awareness of potential new risks that could affect the endeavor. In addition, the members should 
manage uncertainty, which is inherent in all projects. The effects of any activity cannot be predicted 
precisely, and a range of outcomes can occur. The project manager, along with the project team, 
should implement strategies for responding to uncertainty including:
•	 Gathering information. Uncertainty can be reduced by finding out more relevant 
information with high reliability.
•	 Preparing for multiple outcomes. When there are only a few outcomes, the project team 
can prepare for each one, but when there is a large of set of potential outcomes, the project 
team should categorize and assess the causes, estimate the likelihood of occurrence, and focus 
on the most likely potential outcomes.
•	 Set-based design. Multiple designs or alternatives can be investigated early and validated 
progressively in the project to reduce uncertainty and eliminate poorer choices, while learning 
and adapting fast. This refers to an approach in engineering and product development 
where multiple design alternatives or concepts are explored and validated before narrowing 
them down to a single solution (see Figure 3-4). This method is applicable for projects with a 
high degree of uncertainty and allows for a broader exploration of possibilities, encourages 
creative thinking, and reduces the risks of prematurely committing to a single design. As more 
information becomes available, the set of options is gradually refined, leading to a well-informed 
and optimal final design decision.
•	 Build in resilience. The project team and project stakeholders should be able to learn, adapt, 
and respond quickly; for example, if the deadline for a minimum viable product (MVP) is moved 
up. The MVP is a concept used to define the scope of the first release of a solution to customers 
by identifying the fewest number of features or requirements that would deliver value. The team 
can self-organize and reprioritize work activities so more resources are allocated to the activities 
that will ensure the MVP is delivered at the earlier date.

3.3 General Approaches to Risk Management
As risks are pervasive throughout portfolio, program, and project management activities, a 
systematic approach for managing risks is essential for the organization to achieve its strategic 
objectives. In this context of risk management, considerations include, but are not limited to, 
the following:
•	 Continuously evaluate events or circumstances that may occur in the future (their variability and 
ambiguity);
•	 Identify events that could have a positive or negative impact on one or more objectives of the 
enterprise, portfolio, program, or project;
•	 Assess the probability of the event occurring;
•	 Consider the impact of the event should it occur;
•	 Continuously monitor the overall portfolio, program, and project risks;
•	 Continuously manage the overall portfolio, program, and project risks with the aim of keeping 
risk exposure within an acceptable range;

•	 Continuously evaluate exposure to risk (opportunities and threats) to maximize positive impacts 
and minimize negative impacts;
•	 Engage with relevant stakeholders to understand their risk appetite and risk thresholds and 
coach or educate them on the importance of their roles in managing risks;
•	 Decide on an approach to respond to risks; and
•	 Compile the identified risks and manage them for future projects as lessons learned, as a 
contribution to the organization’s risk management assets.
The specific processes for risk management are:
•	 Plan Risk Management,
•	 Identify Risks,
•	 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis,
•	 Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis,
•	 Plan Risk Responses,
•	 Implement Risk Responses, and
•	 Monitor Risks.
For more details on the specific processes for risk management, refer to Section 4.
3.3.1 Factors for Evaluating Risk
Across the continuum of enterprise, portfolio, program, and project risk management, risks exist 
at all levels of the organization. Figure 3-5 provides a framework for classifying risks in one of 
four quadrants based on available information and the degree of ambiguity and variability. See 
Appendix X3 for more details on the classification of each quadrant. Evaluating risk aims to look at 
the impact on the organization should the risk occur and uses the outcome to determine whether 
the risk can be contained within the limits of the portfolio, program, or project capacity. Depending 
on the final determination, risk responses are selected and the risk register updated. Risk responses 
vary for the enterprise, portfolio, program, and project levels. More details will be supplied for each 
level in subsequent sections.
In order for risk management to take place, portfolio, program, and project managers should 
determine the risk probability and impact of each risk to determine the appropriate steps to respond:
•	 Probability. The chance of a risk occurring can range from slightly above 0% to just below 100%.
•	 Impact. Risks, should they occur, can have either a positive or negative consequence for the 
organization. The magnitude or significance of the impact may have varying implications and 
influences.
•	 Compliance. There may be legal or organizational obligations to meet some requirements.
There are additional factors to consider when evaluating risks. For a partial list of risk parameters, 
refer to Appendix X2.

3.3.2 Responding to Risks
There are different approaches to responding to risks within portfolios, programs, or projects, 
depending on whether they are negative or positive. Options to consider for negative risks include:
•	 Accept. This option is available to both positive and negative risks and means the team accepts 
the risk. Acceptance could be passive or active. Passive acceptance does not require any other 
procedure other than documenting the risk and then leaving the team to handle the risk as it 
arises. With an active acceptance method, a contingency reserve is created to cover the loss of 
time, money, or other resources.
•	 Avoid. Threat avoidance is when the threat influences the behaviors and motivation of the team 
or stakeholders to avoid exposure to compromising events altogether.
•	 Escalate. This option is applicable to both positive and negative risks and should be chosen 
when the proposed response falls outside the defined scope or the team’s influence or authority.
•	 Mitigate. In threat mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or 
impact of a threat. Early mitigation is more cost-effective than trying to repair damage after the 
threat has occurred.
•	 Transfer. This option involves shifting the ownership of the risk to a third party to manage the 
risk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs.

Options to consider for positive risks include:
•	 Accept. This option is applicable to both positive and negative risks and is described under the 
options for negative risks.
•	 Enhance. The team acts to increase the probability of occurrence or impact of the opportunity. 
Risk enhancement is best done early in the endeavor.
•	 Escalate. This option is applicable to both positive and negative risks and is described under 
the options for negative risks.
•	 Exploit. The team acts in such a way as to ensure the opportunity occurs so they can take 
advantage of it and the portfolio, program, or project can reap the maximum benefits.
•	 Share. This option involves allocating part of the benefit of an opportunity to a third party that 
is better able to capture the opportunity.

Risk Management Life Cycle in  
Portfolio, Program, and  
Project Management
Organizations create adaptive frameworks to stay in sync with their competitive environments 
and tackle the growing complexities involved in achieving goals and making decisions. 
These complexities are inherent in portfolios, programs, and projects, as well as their 
surrounding environments, and are challenging to manage because of the various elements 
in the workflow: human behavior, system behavior, uncertainty, and ambiguity. Dealing with 
complexity affects the organization’s stability, predictability, capacity, and ability to sustain its 
business activities.
For additional information about managing complexity in the project environment, refer to 
Navigating Complexity: A Practice Guide [5].
4.1 Introduction to the Risk Management Life Cycle
The risk management life cycle described in this section illustrates a structured approach for 
undertaking a comprehensive view of risk throughout the enterprise, portfolio, program, 
and project levels. Even though the way of managing risks differs at each level, and from one 
organization to another, an overall life cycle approach outlines a sequence of logical phases that can 
be iterated and includes the following processes:
•	 Plan Risk Management,
•	 Identify Risks,
•	 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis,
•	 Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis,
•	 Plan Risk Responses,
•	 Implement Risk Responses, and
•	 Monitor Risks.
The risk management life cycle is shown in Figure 4-1. It has a dedicated, procedural, and iterative 
workflow of activities and processes that is integrated, supported, and performed across the 
enterprise and within the portfolio, program, and project levels. Because of the evolutionary 
nature of risk, the risk management life cycle ensures a repeatable sequence of processes fostering 
strategic decision-making.

34
The iterative workflow of the risk management life cycle is embedded within a strategic execution 
framework where portfolio, program, and project management are linked to organizational cultural 
foundations, capabilities, and the use of organizational functions or performance domains. It is 
understood that once a portfolio, program, or project is closed, the risk management process 
terminates, and the appropriate lessons learned are documented. The framework enables the 
overall risk processes to be implemented through a risk management plan within portfolios, 
programs, and projects, as described in Sections 5, 6, and 7.
We will be referring to the following case study throughout this guide. More details of the case 
study will be shared as we go through further elaboration.

Case Study: Introduction to the Compact Wind Turbine Project
A regional municipality has embarked on an ambitious project, the Compact Wind Turbine Project, 
which aligns with the municipality’s strategic objective to embrace sustainability, contribute to 
carbon neutrality, and promote regional development (see Figure 4-2). The efficient, ecofriendly 
wind turbines, already common in both developed and emerging economies, are set to empower 
rural and remote areas, aligning with the strategic objective.
As per the strategic plan, the wind turbines will supply sustainable energy to various sectors, 
including communities, businesses, schools, health clinics, individual households, and farms. The 
adaptable design allows these turbines to meet specific requirements, reinforcing the strategic 
focus on fostering local innovation while promoting global sustainability standards.
However, the project faces various risks, including design inconsistencies, technical difficulties, cost 
escalations, and regulatory challenges. Environmental uncertainties, such as unpredictable weather 
and potential supply chain disruptions, add to the complexity of the project risk landscape. Effective 
risk management is integral to aligning the project with the strategic vision.
Stakeholders
The stakeholder group is diverse and includes the municipality, the energy management department, 
local community members, environmental sustainability advocates, media representatives, the project 
manager, material suppliers, subcontracting agencies, and agricultural landowners.
Each stakeholder has a crucial role in managing project risks. Their contributions will be key to 
strategically driving the project toward its ultimate goal of promoting sustainable development and 
energy independence, thereby aligning the project with the municipality’s broader strategic plan.

4.1.1 Risk Management in Adaptive, Predictive,  
and Hybrid Project Management
In project management, risk management involves identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks. 
Once this has been completed, the next step is to allocate resources to minimize, monitor, and 
control the likelihood or impact of negative events or to maximize opportunities.
However, organizations have the flexibility to choose from different project management 
approaches, each of which is guided by the same risk management steps listed previously. 
These approaches are adaptive, predictive, or hybrid. Each approach has its own strengths and 
weaknesses, and the selection depends on factors such as the specific project, the team involved, 
stakeholder preferences, and the organization’s overall strategy.
In fast-paced and uncertain environments with an expectation of frequent changes, agile and other 
adaptive approaches tend to be more suitable. On the other hand, predictive approaches are better 
suited for stable projects with well-understood requirements and clearly defined outcomes. The 
decision on which approach to use should be based on a thoughtful assessment of the project’s 
characteristics and the unique needs and circumstances of the organization.
The selection of a project management approach has a direct impact on how risks are managed 
throughout the project life cycle. The right choice should be made based on a careful evaluation of 
the project’s unique characteristics and the level of uncertainty involved. To that end, effective risk 
management ensures that potential pitfalls are addressed proactively and that opportunities are 
maximized, ultimately leading to successful project outcomes.
4.1.1.1 Adaptive Project Management Approaches
Risk management is an integral part of the entire project life cycle in adaptive project management 
approaches such as Scrum, Kanban, or other kinds of agile practices. The approaches are designed 
to address and manage risk throughout the project, not just at the beginning during the planning 
phase. Also, high-level preliminary risk identification is required, although it may be at the release 
level and more detailed for the current sprint or iteration.
Early de-risking is achieved by using techniques such as “spikes,” where risk is high and is used to 
expel identified uncertainties. Milestones, such as “stakeholder vision” and “proven architecture,” 
further support effective risk reduction. Refer to Choose Your WoW: A Disciplined Agile Approach to 
Optimizing Your Way of Working [6] for more information.
The characteristics of risk management when using an adaptive approach to project management 
include:
•	 Iterative approach. The project is divided into small, manageable parts that can be 
completed in shorter increments or fixed periods of time. A project can also run quick iterations 
to implement gradual changes within the project while still meeting deadlines and deliverables. 
This allows risks to be identified and addressed early during individual iterations, so they can 
then be considered for future planning.
•	 Continuous risk identification. Because the team constantly reviews and adjusts their work, 
they can quickly identify and react to risks as they emerge. This real-time risk management can 
be much more effective than trying to predict all risks at the outset.
•	 Flexibility. In adaptive approaches to project management, changes are expected and 
embraced. This ability to change course quickly can help treat risks that could be more damaging 
in a rigid project structure.

37
Risk Management Life Cycle in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
•	 Transparency. Regular exercises such as standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives help 
identify risks and manage them early. They provide an opportunity for the team to discuss 
concerns and potential risks and produce strategies to manage them.
•	 Frequent delivery and feedback. Regular delivery of increments and subsequent feedback 
provide continuous improvement opportunities that help identify risks or issues early in the 
project and can minimize the impacts by taking corrective actions earlier.
4.1.1.2 Predictive Project Management Approaches
In predictive project management approaches, such as waterfall, the majority of risk identification 
usually occurs up front during the project planning phase while risk management continues 
throughout the life cycle.
The characteristics of risk management when using a predictive approach to project management 
include:
•	 Initial risk identification. In predictive models, the team attempts to identify high-level risks 
at the beginning of the project and continues to identify risks as the project progresses. This 
process involves using different techniques, e.g., SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, 
threats) analysis, brainstorming, interviews, past projects, etc. All parties should be involved in 
the risk identification process to ensure the various perspectives and experiences are taken into 
consideration. The risks should be reviewed and evaluated based on the impact and likelihood 
of each risk. The risk identification should also include considering multiple outcomes and 
scenarios of each risk and the expected value and variance. Risks can be positive or negative. This 
process should be repeated periodically during the life of the project.
•	 Structured risk management. Risk management is usually structured, often with dedicated 
risk management roles and standardized processes.
•	 Continuous monitoring. Once risks are identified and response plans are in place, it is 
important that the risks and response plans are reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure any 
changes or new risks are taken into consideration as the project progresses. If this process is not 
completed, there is a risk of project delays or cost overruns.
•	 Less frequent delivery and feedback. In predictive approaches, feedback is generally 
obtained at longer intervals, such as at the end of a phase or the end of the project, which may 
make it hard to adjust the risk management strategies during the project.
4.1.1.3 Hybrid Project Management Approaches
Hybrid project management combines predictive and adaptive approaches for flexibility and 
structure in risk management. It strikes a balance between adaptability and predictability, making it 
ideal for projects with both defined and undefined aspects.
The characteristics of risk management when using a hybrid approach to project management 
include:
•	 Initial risk identification and planning. Similar to predictive models, hybrid models often 
involve an initial risk identification and planning phase. The team attempts to identify potential 
risks and creates a high-level plan to treat them.
•	 Iterative development. Similar to adaptive approaches, a hybrid approach also divides the 
project into smaller parts or iterations. This iterative development allows for risks to be assessed 
and addressed on a smaller scale before they can impact the larger project.

38
•	 Flexibility and adaptability. A hybrid approach allows for more flexibility than predictive 
models, meaning risks can be addressed as they emerge and plans can be adjusted as needed. 
Flexibility and adaptability in hybrid models can be beneficial when dealing with unknowns or 
changes in the project.
•	 Structured risk management. Although there is flexibility, hybrid models also incorporate 
structured risk management procedures from predictive models, including the maintenance of a 
risk register, and may have dedicated roles for risk management.
•	 Transparency and communication. Regular meetings and communication allow for 
continuous identification, assessment, and responses to risks. Transparency and communication 
in hybrid models can include elements from adaptive approaches, such as standups, sprint 
planning, and retrospectives, combined with more formal risk-reporting approaches from 
predictive models.
•	 Regular review of risks. The team routinely reviews and adjusts their risk strategies 
throughout the project. The regular review of risks can include updating the risk register, 
reviewing the effectiveness of risk responses, and adjusting plans as needed.
•	 Feedback and learning. Like adaptive approaches, hybrid approaches value learning and 
adaptation gained during each iteration. Feedback is gathered not only at the end of the project, 
but also at the end of each iteration. Feedback and learning can help to adjust risk strategies and 
improve over time.
4.1.2 Integrating Project Risk Management and  
Organizational Risk Management
This section highlights the importance of combining two critical aspects of risk management—
project risk management and organizational risk management—to optimize business resilience and 
enhance project success rates.
The matryoshka, also known as nesting dolls, can provide a perfect metaphor for understanding the 
relationships among an organization’s strategy, portfolios, programs, and projects, especially in the 
context of risk management (see Figure 4-3).
Think of the largest doll as the organization’s overall strategy. This overarching strategy contains 
everything within it, as the largest doll contains all the other dolls. The strategy doll encapsulates 
the general risks the organization may face and sets the direction and tone for how risks should be 
managed across all areas.
Inside the strategy doll, you find the portfolio doll. The portfolio represents a collection of 
programs or projects grouped together to facilitate effective management to achieve strategic 
objectives (The Standard for Portfolio Management [3]). The portfolio doll is smaller than the 
strategy doll because its risk scope is more specific. However, it inherits the strategy doll’s risk 
management direction. Portfolio-level risk management examines the collective risks of its 
constituent programs and projects, plus the risks that emerge from the interactions among 
them.
Next, nestled within the portfolio doll, is the program doll. Programs are groups of related projects 
managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them 
individually (The Standard for Program Management [4]). Programs have more specific, tailored risks

Risk Management Life Cycle in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
that align with their particular objectives. Program risks can come from individual projects but also 
from dependencies and interactions among projects.
Lastly, inside the program doll is the smallest doll—the project doll. Projects are temporary 
endeavors undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. Each project has unique risks 
that should be identified, assessed, and managed. The project-level risks are the most granular, 
which entails looking at the specific risks that could derail a particular project.
In the same way that each doll is integral to the whole set of matryoshka dolls, each level of risk 
management—from the overall strategy to portfolios, programs, and finally, individual projects—is 
vital to the organization’s overall success. This multilevel structure ensures a holistic approach to 
risk management that encompasses every level, from the broadest strategic risks down to the most 
specific project risks.
While project risk management is focused on identifying, analyzing, and counteracting potential 
risks that could impact specific projects—with the key objective of meeting project deliverables in 
terms of time, cost, and quality standards—organizational risk management aims to manage risks 
that affect the entire organization, such as the threats that could disturb the enterprise’s strategic 
objectives, operational continuity, or reputation, expanding beyond the traditional project-centric 
view (see Figure 4-4).
This approach incorporates risk management considerations at different organizational levels 
beyond the completion of the project.

40
There are three primary reasons for integrating these two forms of risk management:
•	 Evolution of risks. Risks identified at the project level can evolve and impact the organization 
at large. Hence, connecting project risk management and organizational risk management 
practices can facilitate early risk detection and prevention.
•	 Alignment of objectives. Linking project risk management and organizational risk 
management ensures that project goals align with the broader organizational objectives, 
significantly contributing to the organization’s overall success.
•	 Consistent risk-focused culture. Integrating project risk management and organizational 
risk management helps to cultivate a uniform risk culture. This promotes a clear understanding 
and effective organizational risk management engagement.
To facilitate this integration, employing the following strategies is recommended:
•	 Open communication. Fostering open and frequent communication among project 
managers and organization/enterprise risk managers aids in identifying and managing risks 
that could escalate and affect the organization. Communication can also help stakeholders 
in identifying secondary risks to their programs or projects resulting from organizational risk 
management activities happening outside of their programs or projects.
•	 Risk management framework. Establishing a comprehensive risk management framework 
that involves governance, risk reporting standards, controls, and compliance policies, as well as 
processes and procedures for execution and checking compliance, should be implemented at 
both the project and organizational levels.
•	 Integrated risk management tools. Incorporating a suite of tools designed to manage 
both project risk management and organizational risk management can help ensure consistent 
and effective risk management across the organization.

Risk Management Life Cycle in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
Understanding and implementing the integration of project risk management and organizational 
risk management is crucial for safeguarding both projects and day-to-day operations from 
unexpected risks. This comprehensive approach to risk management enhances the overall resilience 
of the organization by protecting projects and the entire organization from unforeseen challenges. 
To achieve this, a holistic view of risk management is necessary to establish the right structure 
within the organization’s governance.
By creating the appropriate framework, the organization can clearly define its objectives 
and set external and internal parameters for an effective risk management life cycle. The risk 
management life cycle creation involves establishing risk criteria and processes iteratively, 
ensuring alignment with the organization’s strategies and objectives while allocating resources 
effectively.
The risk management life cycle works within the risk management framework to ensure risks 
are managed in a structured manner—regardless of the portfolio, program, or project life cycle 
approach—and to avoid risks from escalating. Note that “structured” does not mean rigid. The 
structured process provides a systematic and organized approach to risk management, and 
the addition of flexibility ensures that the process remains relevant and effective in dynamic, 
unpredictable environments.
4.1.3 Risk Escalation
Risk escalation refers to the process of elevating the level of risk management from a lower level, 
such as a project or program, to a higher level, such as a portfolio or enterprise. It occurs when risks 
identified at a lower level have the potential to impact the broader scope and objectives of a higher-
level entity.
At the project level, risk escalation involves identifying and assessing threats and opportunities that 
may affect the successful delivery of a specific project. These risks are typically managed within the 
project team and are primarily focused on achieving project objectives.
When risks escalate from the project level to the program level, they become risks that can 
impact the success of multiple related projects within a program. These risks are managed 
collectively, considering their interdependencies and potential impact on program-level 
objectives.
Further escalation occurs when risks are elevated from the program to the portfolio level. Risks at 
the portfolio level are strategic and can have implications for achieving organizational objectives. 
Considering the portfolio’s overall risk appetite and strategic alignment, these risks are managed at 
a higher decision-making level.
In some cases, risks can escalate directly from a project or program to the enterprise level. 
These risks can potentially impact the entire organization and its overall performance, 
reputation, or strategic direction. Managing risks at the organizational level involves the highest 
level of decision-making and requires coordination across various portfolios, programs, and 
projects.
Effective risk escalation involves clear and timely communication, collaboration, and robust 
decision-making processes to ensure that risks are appropriately identified, assessed, and managed 
at the appropriate level of the organizational hierarchy. Appropriate risk escalation allows for a 
holistic view of risks, enabling proactive risk management strategies and informed decision-making 
to protect the organization’s interests and optimize its overall performance.

Case Study: Risk Escalation in the Compact Wind Turbine Project
Using the case study provided earlier in this section, consider the following example of risk escalation:
Project level: The Compact Wind Turbine Project, at the project level, faces immediate risks such 
as design inconsistencies, technical difficulties, and potential supply chain disruptions. For instance, 
a technical difficulty could arise due to a fault in a turbine part, which would require immediate 
rectification to prevent project delays.
Program level: At the program level, this single project is part of a larger initiative aimed at 
promoting sustainable development and energy independence. Hence, any delay or cost overrun in 
this project could affect other projects in the program, such as creating energy storage facilities or 
implementing smart grid technologies. For instance, if supply chain disruptions lead to the delayed 
installation of wind turbines, it could postpone other interconnected projects.
Portfolio level: These programs are grouped under a broader portfolio aimed at embracing 
sustainability and contributing to carbon neutrality. Therefore, project- and program-level risk escalation 
can influence the portfolio. Using the previous example, delays in the Compact Wind Turbine Project and 
subsequent projects could push back the portfolio’s timeline for achieving its sustainability targets.
Organization level: Finally, at the organization level, the municipality has an overarching strategy 
for regional development and carbon neutrality. As a result, significant risks at the portfolio level 
impact the entire organization’s strategic objectives. Continuing with this example, the municipality 
may struggle to fulfill its strategic commitment to carbon neutrality within the planned timeframe if 
the delays in achieving sustainability targets are substantial.
4.1.4 Organizational Project Management  
and Its Application in Risk Management
The risk management life cycle, seamlessly incorporated into project management groups, consists 
of processes such as risk management planning, identification, qualitative and quantitative analysis, 
response planning, implementation, and monitoring. Implementation can differ across levels and 
organizations.
The models offer a two-dimensional framework for project management. One dimension depicts 
maturity levels, while the other highlights the key areas of project management. These areas are 
further divided into critical components for an accurate maturity assessment.
Although the models assess maturity in all project management areas, this section specifically 
delves into risk management maturity, enabling a thorough grasp of its practices and impact on 
project success. It should be noted that the levels of maturity outlined below may vary among 
organizational project management models.
4.1.4.1 Maturity Level 1: Initial Process
At the Level 1 stage, organizations are aware of project management processes but do not 
have standardized practices. There is no obligation for project managers to adhere to particular 
standards, and recordkeeping is inconsistent. The importance of project management is understood 
by management, but any data collection is sporadic and unstructured.

Risk Management Life Cycle in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
In the realm of risk management, organizations at this stage only achieve a minimal portion of the 
standards set by the risk management life cycle. Organizations may recognize the significance of risk 
processes, but their approach is casual, leading to potential gaps. Comprehensive risk management 
actions, from structured planning to ongoing monitoring, have not been integrated. Activities like 
maintaining organized risk logs, convening regular risk discussions, or creating structured response 
plans are lacking.
4.1.4.2 Maturity Level 2: Structured Process and Standards
At the Level 2 stage, organizations have implemented several project management processes. 
However, these are not uniformly accepted as organizational norms. There is documentation 
for these processes and management endorses their use, but a consistent understanding or 
enforcement across all projects is missing. Larger, more high-profile projects receive structured 
management and are typically more systematic. Basic metrics, such as cost, schedule, and 
performance, are tracked, though data may be gathered manually or in a piecemeal fashion. The 
information oscillates between being high level and very detailed.
In terms of risk management, Level 2 organizations exhibit greater maturity, but many key criteria 
remain unfulfilled. Level 2 organizations may, for instance, identify risks but may not have a 
consistent approach to quantify or address them. A comprehensive breakdown of these essential 
risk management success factors will be discussed later in this section.
4.1.4.3 Maturity Level 3: Organizational Standards and Institutionalized Process
At the Level 3 stage, every project management process is standardized across the organization. 
Clients play a crucial role in the project team, and almost all projects adhere to these standardized 
processes. Management has embedded these standards with comprehensive documentation 
available for all procedures. They actively participate in vital decisions, endorsing significant 
documents and addressing major project concerns. Automation is common in project management 
processes, and projects are evaluated in context with others. Regarding risk management, Level 3 
organizations have solid and consistent processes. Activities like risk planning, identification, and 
evaluation align with organizational standards and promote comprehensive risk management. 
While they have standardized risk response plans and frequently review risk strategies, there is room 
for enhancement. To boost their risk management maturity, these organizations should develop 
action plans focusing on specific areas such as refining risk metrics or enhancing communication 
techniques.
4.1.4.4 Maturity Level 4: Managed Process
At the Level 4 stage, projects are overseen with insights from historical performance and future 
projections.
Management employs metrics for both efficiency and impact assessment on other projects. Every 
project, along with its changes and issues, is gauged using metrics derived from cost estimates, 
baseline predictions, and earned value. Project data syncs with other business systems to enhance 
decision-making. Established processes and standards aid in leveraging these metrics for informed 
project choices.
Management not only grasps its role in the project management process, it also adeptly oversees 
projects of various sizes and intricacies, discerning between general management styles and 
specific project requirements. Project management norms are harmonized with broader corporate 
systems and procedures. In terms of risk management, organizations at Level 4 have achieved most 
of the primary success markers for risk management.

Comprehensive change management facilitates integral risk oversight, driving informed business 
choices. For example, emergent project risks are monitored diligently, with swift updates provided 
to all pertinent parties. This ensures prompt, effective responses, diminishing any adverse effects. To 
further hone their risk management maturity, organizations should devise action plans that nurture 
and expand their proactive risk management ethos.
4.1.4.5 Maturity Level 5: Optimizing Process
At the Level 5 stage, processes are not only in place but are also actively used to boost project 
management tasks. Insights from previous projects are consistently analyzed and applied 
to refine project management methods, standards, and documentation. The organization, 
along with its management, is focused not just on effective project management, but 
also on ongoing enhancement. Metrics obtained during the project execution phase help 
guide understanding of individual project outcomes and shape broader organizational 
decisions.
Regarding risk management, Level 5 organizations embody a continual improvement mindset. 
Nearly all crucial benchmarks for the risk management life cycle are met at this optimized process 
stage, where risk management is seamlessly interwoven into project management activities. Risks 
are systematically pinpointed, evaluated, and addressed. Established protocols exist for observing 
these risks and adjusting strategies when required. Furthermore, Level 5 organizations perpetually 
refine their processes by drawing lessons from past projects, showcasing a deeply ingrained, 
forward-thinking approach to risk management.
4.2 Plan Risk Management
A comprehensive risk management strategy necessitates the formulation of a risk management 
plan. This plan outlines the execution of risk management processes and their integration with 
other processes. Essentially, it delineates the connections among risk management processes; 
overarching portfolio, program, or project management; and the organization’s primary 
management practices. Risk management planning commences early in the overarching 
project planning phase, with its activities ingrained within the principal management 
strategy. This plan remains adaptable, adjusting to evolving work demands and stakeholder 
needs.
The practicality of such planning is influenced by the organization’s characteristics. The stipulations 
set forth in the risk management plan echo the organization’s culture; available resources; and 
underlying values, aims, and targets. This plan also pinpoints pertinent organizational practices, 
taking into account factors like strategic risk management, enterprise risk management, and 
corporate governance procedures.
4.2.1 Purpose of Plan Risk Management
The objectives of the Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management 
strategy, decide how the risk management processes will be executed, and integrate risk 
management with all other activities. The risk management plan defines both the normal 
frequency of repeating the processes and the specific or exceptional conditions under which the 
corresponding actions are initiated. The corresponding risk management activities are integrated 
into the portfolio, program, or project management plan.

Risk Management Life Cycle in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
4.2.1.1 Risk Appetite in Plan Risk Management
The level of risk that is considered acceptable depends on the risk appetites of the relevant stakeholders. 
A number of factors may affect stakeholders’ risk appetites. These include the stakeholders’ abilities 
to tolerate uncertainty and the relative importance of achieving specific objectives. The output of this 
analysis is then considered when applying the risk management processes.
Guidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders 
reflect the stakeholders’ risk appetites and expectations. As the work evolves, maintaining effective 
communication with the stakeholders enables portfolio, program, and project managers to become 
aware of any changes in the stakeholders’ attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to 
take into account any new factors.
The risk management plan provides terminology for participants to share a common understanding 
of the terms. The risk management plan also defines the critical values of risk management and 
the thresholds that serve as parameters in a manner consistent with the scope of the work and the 
attitudes of the stakeholders. Similarly, the risk management plan specifies the key numerical values 
required in quantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring.
4.2.1.2 Tailoring and Scaling the Risk Management Plan
Portfolios, programs, and projects are exposed to different types of risk, so each step in the 
risk management life cycle is tailored and scaled to meet the various risk characteristics. The 
management processes are also tightly integrated among the portfolio, program, and project levels.
To ensure a shared understanding of the scope and goals of the risk management process, the 
stakeholders document, communicate, and then review the initial step’s results.
The risk management plan includes tailored risk management processes that are based on the 
organization’s process maturity. Scalable elements of the process that are part of risk management 
planning include but are not limited to:
•	 Available resources. Resources refer to both human resources and financial resources 
dedicated to risk management.
•	 Escalation paths. These paths include a detailed protocol for escalating identified risks throughout 
the portfolio, program, project, and organizational levels, depending on the risk severity.
•	 Approaches and processes used. Approaches and processes used may include regular 
risk assessment meetings, implementation of a risk register, or use of risk response strategies 
such as risk avoidance, transference, or acceptance, as will be discussed in further sections.
•	 Tools and techniques used. Tools and techniques refer to the specific risk management tools 
or software the organization uses to track and manage risks.
•	 Supporting infrastructure. Supporting infrastructure includes the systems and processes in 
place that aid in risk management.
•	 Review and update frequency. Review and update frequency refer to the frequency at 
which the risk management plan is reviewed and updated, keeping it relevant and effective.
•	 Reporting requirements. The reporting requirements refer to the specific requirements 
for reporting on risk management, including the type of information needed, the frequency of 
reports, and to whom they should be sent.

Case Study: Tailoring and Scaling the Risk Management Plan in the 
Compact Wind Turbine Project
In the Compact Wind Turbine Project, a specialized risk management team will determine which 
available resources may be allocated to the project, along with a dedicated budget to handle 
potential risk-related issues. The team may decide that no extra resources will be dedicated to the 
municipality’s carbon-footprint-tracking web application development project, and the existing 
team will engage in the entire cycle of risk management.
When determining potential escalation paths for identified risks in the Compact Wind Turbine 
Project, a supply chain disruption risk may first be addressed at the project level, but if unresolved, it 
could be escalated to the program or even portfolio level.
When selecting which approaches and processes to use, the specific risk management strategies 
that the municipality applies will depend on the overall project management approach—adaptive, 
predictive, or hybrid.
One of the tools and techniques used in the Compact Wind Turbine Project includes a risk modeling 
software that could be used to predict potential cost escalations or project delays.
Supporting infrastructure for the project may include an integrated project management software 
system that helps monitor all aspects of the project, including the risk management activities.
The Compact Wind Turbine Project will also select its own risk review and update frequency. For 
example, risks could be reviewed weekly at team meetings and the plan could be updated quarterly.
From there, the project may decide to include risk updates in the monthly project reports that are 
sent to the municipality’s energy management department.
These scalable elements ensure that the risk management plan is flexible and responsive to the 
changing project environment. Such elements will help the municipality’s Compact Wind Turbine 
Project and other efforts stay aligned with its strategic objectives.
4.2.2 Key Success Factors for Plan Risk Management
The criteria for creating a valid risk management plan include:
•	 Stakeholder acceptance. For a risk management plan to be valid, it should be accepted 
by all key stakeholders. Regular meetings, public forums, or surveys could be used to ensure 
stakeholders understand and agree with the risk management approach.
•	 Identification and correction of bias. Any conscious or unconscious bias can skew the risk 
management process. Identifying and correcting these biases is important to ensure a fair and 
balanced approach. Including diverse perspectives, as well as holding facilitated workshops with 
a neutral facilitator to guide the discussion, helps ensure participation from all stakeholders and 
assists in challenging biased viewpoints to help correct bias.
•	 Alignment with constraints and priorities. The risk management plan should align with 
both internal and external constraints and priorities.

Risk Management Life Cycle in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
•	 Balance of cost, effort, and benefit. A successful risk management plan maintains a balance 
between the cost and effort of implementing risk response strategies and the expected benefits.
•	 Completeness with respect to risk management process needs. The plan should 
fully address the requirements of the risk management process, from risk identification and 
assessment to response planning, implementation, and monitoring.
Case Study: Planning Risk Management in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
In the case of the municipality, creating a valid risk management plan will involve considering the 
key factors as they relate to the Compact Wind Turbine Project.
Stakeholder acceptance should come not only from municipal officials and staff, but also 
community members, local businesses, and other relevant entities that may be impacted by the 
sustainability initiative.
Planning will also involve the identification and correction of any biases about the Compact 
Wind Turbine Project. If an assessment overemphasizes the potential financial risks while 
underemphasizing the environmental risks, this bias needs to be identified and corrected to help 
ensure a balanced sustainability focus.
To align with the municipality’s constraints and existing priorities, the Plan Risk Management 
process should consider any budget constraints as well as the municipality’s priority to reduce 
carbon emissions. These factors should also be considered when developing the risk management 
plan for all of the portfolios, programs, and projects that correspond to the municipality’s strategic 
objective to embrace sustainability and contribute to carbon neutrality.
The Compact Wind Turbine Project’s risk management planning should focus on achieving a 
balance of the cost, effort, and benefits of the project. The municipality’s investment in renewable 
energy sources may have high up-front costs and require substantial effort, but the long-term 
benefits in terms of reducing emissions and energy costs should also be factored into the risk 
management plan to determine an appropriate balance.
In an effort to achieve completeness with respect to the Plan Risk Management process needs for 
the Compact Wind Turbine Project, the municipality should consider risks related to location, species 
endangerment, long-term maintenance, potential health impacts, and community engagement, 
among other factors.
4.3 Identify Risks
Once the risk management scope and objectives are agreed upon, the process of identifying risks 
begins, with care taken to distinguish genuine risks from nonrisks, such as concerns and issues. It 
is unlikely that all risks are, or even should be, identified at the outset. Over time, the risk exposure 
level may change due to the decisions and actions taken previously as well as externally imposed 
changes.

48
4.3.1 Purpose of Identify Risks
The purpose of risk identification is to identify key risks to the extent practicable. The emergent 
nature of risk requires the risk management process to be iterative, repeating the risk identification 
activities to find risks that were not previously evident.
Various risk identification techniques are available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. 
One or more techniques can be selected, as appropriate, to meet the needs of a specific portfolio, 
program, or project. The aim is to expose and document all known risks, recognizing that some are 
inherently unknown and others will emerge later in the work. Input is sought from a wide range 
of stakeholders when identifying risks, since each stakeholder may have a different perspective on 
the risks facing the portfolio, program, or project. Historical records and documents may also be 
reviewed to help identify risks.
When a risk is first identified, preliminary responses may be identified at the same time. These are 
recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action when appropriate. 
When such responses are not implemented immediately, they should be considered during the Plan 
Risk Responses process.
All identified risks are recorded and a risk owner may be identified at the same time. The risk 
owner is the individual responsible for monitoring the risk and selecting and implementing an 
appropriate risk response strategy. The risk owner’s responsibility is to manage the corresponding 
risk throughout the subsequent risk management processes.
4.3.2 Key Success Factors for Identify Risks
Success in achieving the objectives of the Identify Risks process includes but is not limited to the 
following steps:
•	 Early risk identification. This step encompasses the proactive process of identifying 
potential risks at the beginning of a project. Organizations can take preventive measures to 
minimize negative consequences or to capitalize on opportunities by identifying risks early on. 
The benefits include proactive risk management, effective resource allocation, and stakeholder 
engagement.
•	 Iterative risk identification. This step entails the ongoing process of adapting to the 
nature of the project and involves identifying risks throughout the project life cycle on a 
continual basis, considering the project’s specific characteristics. This approach allows for 
the discovery of new risks and adjustments to risk management strategies as the project 
progresses. The iterative identification of risks based on the nature of the project ensures that 
risk management remains dynamic and adaptable to the project’s unique circumstances. 
Iterative risk identification facilitates a proactive approach to risk management, allowing 
project teams to address emerging risks in a timely manner and increase the chances of 
project success.
•	 Comprehensive risk identification. This step involves using multiple techniques and 
relevant stakeholders to identify key risks thoroughly. These techniques may include but are 
not limited to premortem brainstorming sessions, documentation review, expert interviews, 
assumptions analysis, reviewing lessons learned, SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,

Risk Management Life Cycle in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
threats) analysis, checklists, simulations, and scenario analysis. Organizations can use various 
approaches to capture a wide range of potential risks and develop a more robust risk 
management plan.
•	 Explicit identification of opportunities and innovation. This step involves actively 
recognizing and capturing positive events or circumstances that can benefit a project 
and includes identifying and leveraging technological advancements like artificial 
intelligence (AI), large language models (LLM), and machine learning (ML); forming 
strategic partnerships; improving processes; and capitalizing on competitive advantages. 
Organizations can proactively seek opportunities to enhance project outcomes and gain a 
competitive edge.
•	 Multiple perspectives with high confidence. High confidence in risk identification 
requires involving diverse stakeholders, who bring different insights and expertise. This 
approach ensures comprehensive risk coverage, enhanced risk understanding, increased 
accuracy, and stakeholder engagement, improving overall risk management strategies and 
project success.
•	 Connecting risks to objectives. This step involves linking identified risks to project 
objectives, helping organizations to prioritize risks, inform decision-making, develop targeted 
risk responses, and measure progress. This approach ensures that risk management efforts align 
with strategic goals, leading to successful project outcomes.
•	 Complete risk statement. To ensure effective risk identification, a complete risk statement 
is required because it enhances clarity, facilitates prioritization, supports risk response planning, 
and enables effective communication. Clear risk statements aid in understanding and managing 
risks, leading to improved project outcomes. An example of an effective risk statement would be 
one that captures the event, cause, and impact.
•	 Risk ownership. This step ensures accountability for managing risks while providing a 
high level of detail and enhancing risk assessment and response planning. Together, they 
contribute to proactive and comprehensive risk management, while mitigating potential 
impacts on project success. Having a risk owner means having someone dedicated to 
managing risk, which includes assessing it thoroughly and ensuring appropriate response 
planning. Risks can be identified by anyone, but assigning an owner to a specific risk will 
ensure they own it, are accountable for it, and provide the right amount of detail in order to 
manage it effectively.
•	 Frequent and effective communication. Frequent and effective communication is 
crucial for successful risk management. It involves timely updates, transparent information 
sharing, stakeholder engagement, risk-related discussions, and proper reporting. By prioritizing 
communication, organizations enhance risk awareness, enable informed decision-making, and 
nurture a collaborative risk management culture.
•	 Objectivity to minimize bias. Biases in projects can affect risk management. Examples 
include confirmation bias, where individuals favor information that confirms their beliefs; 
availability bias, which focuses on easily recalled information; anchoring bias, which relies heavily 
on initial data; and overconfidence bias, where individuals underestimate risks due to excessive 
confidence. Being aware of these biases helps promote objectivity in risk assessment and 
decision-making.

Case Study: Identifying Risks in the Compact Wind Turbine Project
In the Compact Wind Turbine Project, early risk identification involves conducting workshops to 
identify risks, assess and prioritize them, document them in a risk register, monitor and review them, 
and develop response plans.
In the municipality’s carbon-footprint-tracking web application, the initial risk identification 
may focus on technical risks, such as compatibility issues, or application vulnerabilities, such as 
security breaches. However, as the project advances and user requirements evolve, new risks 
related to user acceptance or scope changes may emerge. By iteratively identifying risks based on 
the changing nature of the project, the project team can effectively manage and respond to these 
evolving risks.
4.4 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
Qualitative risk analysis evaluates the importance of each risk to categorize and prioritize individual 
risks for further attention. It also provides a mechanism for evaluating the level of overall portfolio, 
program, or project risk.
Qualitative risk analysis typically involves techniques such as risk probability and impact assessment, 
risk ranking or scoring, risk matrix analysis, and expert judgment. These techniques provide a 
qualitative understanding of the risks, allowing for initial decision-making and the identification of 
risks that require further quantitative analysis or more detailed risk assessment.
By performing qualitative risk analysis, organizations can gain valuable insights into their risk 
landscape, focus their attention on high-priority risks, develop appropriate risk management 
strategies to respond to potential threats, and explore opportunities.
4.4.1 Purpose of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
Qualitative techniques are used to assess individual risks. Qualitative techniques consider a range of 
characteristics, such as probability or likelihood of occurrence, degree of impact on the objectives, 
manageability, timing of possible impacts, relationships with other risks, and common causes or 
effects.
Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk, if it 
occurs, will have an impact on the portfolio, program, or project objectives. As such, this assessment 
does not directly address the overall risk resulting from the combined effect of all risks and their 
potential interactions. This can, however, be achieved through the use of quantitative risk analysis 
techniques.
Qualitative risk analysis is applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify Risks 
process to provide management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most 
influence (positive or negative) on achieving the objectives. Risks that are assessed as high 
priority, and that either threaten or enhance the achievement of objectives, are highlighted in 
the Plan Risk Responses process. These risks may be further analyzed using quantitative risk 
analysis.

4.4.2 Key Success Factors for Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis
Success in achieving the objectives of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process includes but is 
not limited to:
•	 Use an agreed-upon approach. Establishing a standardized approach for conducting 
qualitative risk analysis is essential. This approach ensures consistency and allows for 
comparability across different projects or situations. Having an agreed-upon approach helps in 
understanding and assessing risks in a systematic, uniform manner.
•	 Use agreed-upon definitions of risk terms. In risk analysis, it is important to understand 
the terminology and use it clearly. The meaning of risk-related terms such as probability, impact, 
likelihood, and severity should be well defined and agreed upon by all stakeholders involved. 
Consistent and shared definitions help facilitate effective communication and accurate risk 
assessment.
•	 Collect credible information about risks. To perform a qualitative risk analysis, gathering 
relevant and reliable information about the identified risks is necessary. This information can be 
obtained through various means, such as interviews, surveys, historical data, industry reports, 
and expert opinions. Collecting credible information ensures the accuracy and validity of the risk 
analysis process.
•	 Perform iterative qualitative risk analysis. Qualitative risk analysis is not a one-time 
activity, but is an iterative process involving continuous risk evaluation and reevaluation. It is 
important to revisit and review the risk analysis periodically to update and refine the assessment 
based on new information or changes in the project environment. The iterative analysis allows 
for the identification of emerging risks, the reassessment of existing risks, and the adjustment of 
risk response strategies accordingly.
4.5 Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides insight into the combined effect of 
identified risks on the desired outcome. This process takes into account probabilistic or component-
wide effects, such as the correlation among risks, interdependencies, and feedback loops. The 
process provides an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the portfolio, program, or 
project.
4.5.1 Purpose of Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect 
of risk on the objectives. Results from this analysis are used to evaluate the likelihood of success in 
achieving objectives and to estimate any contingency reserves.
Analyzing uncertainty using quantitative techniques provides a more realistic estimate than a 
nonprobabilistic approach. However, quantitative risk analysis is not always required or possible. 
Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process, the benefits of quantitative risk analysis 
should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the additional insights and value 
justify the additional effort.
A partial risk analysis, such as a qualitative risk analysis, prioritizes only individual risks and therefore 
does not produce measures of overall risk where all risks are considered simultaneously.

52
Calculating estimates of overall risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. 
Specific risks are usually best understood and quantified at a detailed level. In contrast, objectives are 
specified at a higher level. An overall risk analysis using quantitative techniques helps estimate the 
implications of all quantified risks. Thus, a thorough understanding of individual risks and their relative 
importance to objectives enhances quantitative risk analysis and the subsequent assessments of risks. 
The overall risk may determine the priority that should be placed on specific risks.
Estimating overall risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish the quantified risks that 
threaten objectives beyond the stakeholders’ tolerance from those risks that are within acceptable 
tolerances, even when the risk is considered. The risks that threaten objectives beyond the 
stakeholders’ tolerance may be targeted for vigorous risk responses aimed at protecting the 
objectives that are most important to the stakeholders.
4.5.2 Key Success Factors for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
Success in achieving the objectives of quantitative risk analysis includes but is not limited to:
•	 Effective prior risk identification and qualitative risk analysis. These are preliminary 
steps where potential risks are identified and qualitative analysis is performed to understand 
their impact and probability. This analysis forms the basis for the later quantitative risk analysis 
and gives it a solid starting point. This step allows for an early stage of understanding risks, their 
nature, and their potential effect on the project or process.
•	 Appropriate model. Quantitative risk analysis requires statistical models to project potential 
outcomes based on the identified risks. Selecting an appropriate model is crucial, as it forms the 
basis of quantitative risk analysis. The model should accommodate all identified risks and their 
interrelationships and provide accurate, understandable results.
•	 Competence with the corresponding technical analysis tools. The tools used for 
analysis should be in line with the model chosen. Users should be competent with these tools 
to ensure accurate results. This step may require training or hiring staff with the necessary 
expertise.
•	 Commitment to collecting credible risk data. Reliable, accurate, and comprehensive 
data form the backbone of quantitative risk analysis. The data collected should be based on 
comprehensive and unbiased facts. Commitment to this process ensures the quality and validity 
of the results.
•	 Unbiased data. The data used in quantitative risk analysis should be objective and unbiased. 
Any bias in the data could lead to skewed results, undermining the value and accuracy of the risk 
analysis.
•	 Understanding interrelationships among risks in quantitative risk analysis. Risks are 
often not isolated and may be interconnected. Understanding these interconnections is critical, 
as it can provide insights into how risks can compound or interact. This insight forms a more 
holistic view of the risk landscape and allows for more accurate modeling and forecasting.
4.6 Plan Risk Responses
The Plan Risk Responses process determines the appropriate response actions for the priority 
of the individual risks and the overall risk. This process takes into account the stakeholders’ 
risk attitudes and the conventions specified in the risk management plan, in addition to

Risk Management Life Cycle in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
any constraints and assumptions that were determined when the risks were identified 
and analyzed. Once individual risks have been prioritized, appropriate risk responses are 
developed for both threats and opportunities. This process continues until an optimal set 
of responses has been developed. A range of possible responses exists for both threats and 
opportunities.
Five responses may be considered for dealing with threats:
•	 Escalate. Escalation is appropriate when a threat is outside of the portfolio, program, or 
project scope or when the proposed response exceeds a given manager’s authority. Escalated 
risks are managed at the enterprise, portfolio, or program level, or other relevant parts of the 
organization. The relevant party in the organization accepts ownership of escalated threats. A 
threat is usually escalated to the appropriate level that matches the objective that would be 
affected if the threat occurred.
•	 Avoid. Risk avoidance is when the portfolio, program, or project team acts to eliminate a threat 
or protect an activity from any impact of risk realization. This strategy may be appropriate for a 
high-priority threat with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative impact. Avoidance 
may involve changing some aspect of the risk management plan or changing the objective 
that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat’s impact entirely. Should the risk materialize, 
it would have no effect on the objective. The risk owner may also take action to isolate the 
objective from the risk’s impact if it were to occur.
•	 Transfer. Transference involves shifting the responsibility of a threat to a third party to manage 
the risk and bear the impact if the threat occurs. Risk transference often involves the payment of 
a risk premium to the party taking on the threat.
•	 Mitigate. In risk mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of a threat’s occurrence and/
or impact if the threat occurs. An early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to 
repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Where it is not possible to reduce the probability, a 
mitigation response may reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity.
•	 Accept. Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat; however, no proactive 
measures are taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority threats or when it is not 
possible or cost-effective to address a threat in any other way. Acceptance can be either active 
or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, 
including amounts of time, money, or other resources, to handle the threat if it occurs. Passive 
acceptance involves no proactive action aside from a periodic review of the threat to ensure that 
it does not change significantly.
Case Study: Responses to Threats in the Compact Wind Turbine Project
In the case study, the five responses to threats could entail the following:
•	 Escalate. The municipality may identify a threat related to the broader environmental impact 
of the wind turbine project, such as potential harm to local bird populations. This threat may be 
outside the project’s scope or exceed the project manager’s authority. In this case, the threat 
may be escalated to a higher level in the organization such as the environmental department or 
a regulatory body. This higher authority would then take ownership of and manage the threat

54
appropriately. For instance, the environmental department may conduct a thorough impact 
assessment and develop a mitigation plan to protect local bird populations. By escalating the 
threat to the appropriate level, the municipality can ensure that it is properly managed and that 
the potential impact on the project objectives is minimized.
•	 Avoid. The municipality may identify a high-priority threat of regulatory challenges that could 
halt the Compact Wind Turbine Project. To avoid this risk, they may decide to change some 
aspects of the project management plan to eliminate the threat entirely. For instance, they may 
decide to use a different, approved model if the regulatory bodies do not approve a particular 
type of wind turbine. This strategy would help ensure that the project can proceed without the 
risk of regulatory challenges, thereby isolating the project objectives from the impact of this risk.
•	 Transfer. The municipality may identify the threat of technical difficulties in the operation of 
the wind turbines. To transfer this risk, they could contract with a third-party service provider 
specializing in wind turbine maintenance and repair. This third party would then be responsible 
for managing the risk of technical difficulties and would bear the impact if such difficulties 
occurred. In return, the municipality would pay a risk premium to the service provider, which 
could be a fixed fee, a percentage of the project budget, or some other form of compensation. 
This arrangement would allow the municipality to focus on other aspects of the project while 
ensuring the technical difficulties are properly managed.
•	 Mitigate. The municipality may identify the threat of design inconsistencies in the wind turbines. 
To address this threat, they could take early action, such as implementing rigorous quality control 
checks and standardizing design processes, to reduce the probability of inconsistencies occurring. 
If it is not possible to completely eliminate the probability of design inconsistencies, stakeholders 
could focus on reducing the impact. For instance, they could establish a dedicated team to quickly 
address any design issues that arise, thereby minimizing the impact on the overall project timeline 
and budget. This strategy would target the factors driving the threat’s severity, such as project 
implementation delays or cost overruns.
•	 Accept. In the Compact Wind Turbine Project, active and passive acceptance of threats could 
entail the following:
	
o	 Active acceptance: The municipality may acknowledge the threat of unpredictable 
weather affecting the operation of the wind turbines. However, due to the inherent nature 
of weather, they may not take immediate action to prevent this risk. Instead, they could 
establish a contingency reserve of funds to be used for maintenance or repairs if severe 
weather damages the turbines. They could also develop a contingency plan to execute 
should such an event occur.
	
o	 Passive acceptance: The municipality may recognize the threat of potential supply chain 
disruptions due to global economic conditions or other external factors. However, due to the 
complexity and unpredictability of these factors, they may decide not to take immediate action. 
This typically occurs when the cost to remediate a threat is higher than the anticipated benefit 
of that remediation. Instead, they could periodically review the threat, keeping track of changes 
in the global economy or the stability of their suppliers that could increase the risk of supply 
chain disruptions.

Risk Management Life Cycle in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
Case Study: Responses to Opportunities in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
In the case study, the five responses to opportunities could entail the following:
•	 Escalate. The municipality may identify an opportunity to expand the Compact Wind Turbine 
Project to other regions or sectors currently outside of the project scope. For example, they may 
see an opportunity to use wind turbines to power public transportation systems or to sell surplus 
energy to other municipalities. However, this plan may exceed the project manager’s authority or 
the current project scope. In this case, the opportunity could be escalated to a higher level in the 
organization such as the regional government or the energy department. It is important that the 
escalated opportunity be accepted by the relevant party. For instance, the regional government 
may need to approve the expansion of the project, or the energy department may need to agree 
Five responses may be considered for dealing with opportunities:
•	 Escalate. This risk response strategy is appropriate when an opportunity is outside the 
portfolio, program, or project scope or when the proposed response exceeds a given manager’s 
authority. Escalated opportunities are managed at the portfolio or program level or by other 
relevant parts of the organization. It is crucial that the appropriate party in the organization 
accepts ownership of an escalated opportunity. Opportunities are usually escalated to the level 
that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred.
•	 Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the 
organization wants to ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to capture 
the benefit associated with a particular opportunity by ensuring that it definitely happens, 
increasing the probability of its occurrence to 100%.
•	 Share. Sharing involves allocating ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that the third 
party shares some of the benefit if the opportunity occurs. It is important to carefully select the 
new owner of a shared opportunity to ensure the capture of the opportunity for the benefit of 
the portfolio, program, or project. Risk sharing often involves the payment of a risk premium to 
the party taking on the opportunity.
•	 Enhance. This strategy is used to increase an opportunity’s probability and/or impact. Early 
enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the benefit after the opportunity 
has occurred. The probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing 
attention on its causes. Where it is not possible to increase the probability, an enhancement 
response may increase the impact by targeting factors that drive the size of the potential benefit.
•	 Accept. Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence, although no proactive action 
is taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority opportunities and may also be 
adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address an opportunity in any other way. 
Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is 
establishing a contingency reserve—including amounts of time, money, or other resources—to 
take advantage of the opportunity, or the development of a contingency plan, which could be 
implemented if it appears that the opportunity is being realized. Passive acceptance involves 
taking no proactive action aside from a periodic review of the opportunity to ensure that it does 
not change significantly.

to manage the sale of surplus energy. By escalating the opportunity to the appropriate level, the 
municipality can ensure it is properly managed and the potential benefits are realized.
•	 Exploit. The municipality may identify the opportunity to use wind turbines to contribute to 
carbon neutrality as a high-priority opportunity. To exploit this opportunity, the municipality 
could take action to ensure that it occurs. For instance, the municipality could invest heavily in 
the Compact Wind Turbine Project, ensuring that enough turbines are installed and operational 
to meet their carbon neutrality goals. They could also prioritize this project in their strategic 
planning, allocate sufficient resources, and engage key stakeholders to help ensure its success. 
By doing so, the municipality increases the probability of occurrence to 100%, ensuring that 
the benefits associated with this opportunity, such as reduced carbon emissions, energy 
independence, and alignment with global sustainability standards, are fully realized.
•	 Share. The municipality may identify an opportunity to share the benefits of the Compact Wind 
Turbine Project with a third party such as a private energy company or a nonprofit organization 
focused on sustainable energy. For example, they could transfer the ownership of some turbines to 
this third party. In return, the third party could share some of the benefits if the opportunity arises, 
such as a portion of the energy produced or the profits from selling the energy. This could help the 
municipality spread the costs and risks associated with the project, while also ensuring the benefits of 
the project are realized. However, this likely involves the payment of a risk premium to the third party 
taking on the opportunity. This could be a fixed fee, a percentage of the profits, or some other form 
of compensation. The municipality would need to carefully select the new owner to ensure that the 
opportunity is captured for the benefit of the project and aligns with their strategic objectives.
•	 Enhance. The municipality may identify an opportunity to enhance the impact of the wind turbines 
by tailoring them to meet the specific requirements of different sectors. For instance, they could focus 
on the causes that would increase the probability of this opportunity, such as investing in research 
and development to improve the adaptable design of the turbines. To enhance the impact, the 
municipality could target factors that drive the size of the potential benefit. For example, they could 
collaborate with local businesses, schools, health clinics, and farms to understand their specific energy 
needs. By customizing the turbines to meet these needs, the municipality could increase the impact 
of the project, leading to greater energy savings and more widespread adoption of sustainable 
energy solutions. This strategy could enhance the project’s benefits and align with the municipality’s 
strategic objective of promoting regional development and sustainability.
•	 Accept. In the Compact Wind Turbine Project, active and passive acceptance of opportunities 
could entail the following:
	
o	 Active acceptance: The municipality may acknowledge the opportunity to use the wind 
turbines to promote local innovation. However, they may not take immediate action due to 
budget constraints or other priorities. Instead, they could establish a contingency reserve of 
funds to be used when the opportunity becomes more feasible. For instance, they may set 
aside a portion of the budget to invest in research and development or training programs to 
foster local innovation when the time is right.
	
o	 Passive acceptance: The municipality may recognize the opportunity to use wind 
turbines to supply sustainable energy to various sectors like schools, health clinics, and 
farms. However, due to the complexity of the project and the risks involved, they may decide 
to avoid taking immediate action. Instead, the municipality could periodically review the 
opportunity, keeping track of changes in technology, market demand, or the regulatory 
environment, which could make it more feasible or attractive in the future.

57
Risk Management Life Cycle in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
Responses are planned at a general, strategic level, and the strategy is validated and agreed 
upon prior to developing the detailed tactical approach. Once that is accomplished, the 
responses are expanded into actions at the tactical level and integrated into the relevant 
management plans. This activity may generate additional secondary risks that may need to be 
addressed at this time.
In addition to individual risk responses, actions may be taken to respond to the overall portfolio, 
program, or project risk. All response strategies and actions are documented, communicated to key 
stakeholders, and incorporated into the relevant plans.
4.6.1 Purpose of Plan Risk Responses
The Plan Risk Responses process aims to determine the set of actions that provides the highest 
chance of success while complying with applicable constraints. Once risks have been identified, 
analyzed, and prioritized, plans are developed for addressing each risk that the team considers 
sufficiently important, either because of the threat it poses to the objectives or because of the 
opportunity it offers. The plans describe the agreed actions to be taken and the potential changes 
that these actions may cause.
Risk responses, when implemented, can have potential effects on the objectives and, as 
such, can generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and are analyzed and 
planned for in the same way as those initially identified. There may be residual risks that remain 
after the responses are implemented. These residual risks are clearly identified, analyzed, 
documented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders continuously until they are 
satisfied.
4.6.2 Key Success Factors for Plan Risk Responses
Success in achieving the objectives of the Plan Risk Responses process includes but is not limited to 
the following:
•	 Clearly define roles and responsibilities for implementing risk responses. This clarity 
helps everyone involved in the project to know their role when it comes to managing risks. This 
includes knowing who is responsible for identifying, assessing, and responding to risks and who 
has the authority to make decisions about risk responses.
•	 Specify the timing of risk responses. This task helps determine when risk responses 
should be implemented. Some risks may require immediate action, while others can be 
addressed at a later stage in the project. By specifying the timing of risk responses, risks can 
be addressed in a timely manner and resources can be used efficiently. Some risks, like design 
inconsistencies or technical difficulties, should be addressed immediately to prevent delays in 
the project. Other risks, like potential supply chain disruptions, can be addressed as they arise. 
The project manager should specify the timing of these responses to ensure efficient use of 
resources.
•	 Provide resources, budget, and a schedule for responses. This task helps to 
allocate sufficient resources (including time, money, labor, and materials) to implement the 
risk responses. This allocation may involve setting aside a contingency budget for dealing 
with risks or scheduling extra time in the project management plan to deal with potential 
issues.

58
•	 Address the interaction of risks and responses, considering secondary and 
residual risks. This task helps to consider how different risks and responses may interact. For 
example, a response to one risk could inadvertently increase another risk (a secondary risk), or 
there may be some level of risk that remains even after the response has been implemented 
(a residual risk). Considering these interactions assists in developing more effective and 
comprehensive risk responses. Additionally, some level of risk may remain even after a response 
to environmental uncertainties has been implemented. The project manager should consider 
these interactions when planning risk responses.
•	 Ensure appropriate, timely, effective, and agreed-upon responses. All relevant 
stakeholders should agree that risk responses are suitable for the risks they are designed to 
address. Responses should also be implemented in a timely manner to effectively reduce the risk. 
This ensures that everyone is on the same page and that risk responses are as effective as possible.
•	 Address both threats and opportunities. Addressing both threats and opportunities 
reiterates the fact that not all risks are negative. Some risks may present opportunities 
that could benefit the project if managed correctly. By addressing both threats and 
opportunities, potential issues can be prevented while also pursuing and taking advantage 
of potential benefits.
Case Study: Planning Risk Responses in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
Clearly defined roles and responsibilities for implementing risk responses are key considerations 
in planning risk responses for the Compact Wind Turbine Project. Each project stakeholder has a 
crucial role in managing project risks as they arise. For example, the municipality is responsible for 
regulatory compliance, the energy management department oversees technical aspects, and local 
community members are involved in monitoring environmental impacts.
Then, with the specific timing of the identified risk responses determined, the municipality should 
allocate sufficient resources to manage the risks. The municipality may need to set aside a contingency 
budget to deal with cost escalations or schedule extra time to deal with potential regulatory 
challenges. When other potential secondary or residual risks may arise in the project, it is important 
to consider how these risks may interact with other risks. For example, addressing the risk of design 
inconsistencies with the wind turbine may inadvertently increase the risk of cost escalations in the 
project. Consideration of all of the potential interactions helps to determine more effective and 
comprehensive risk responses as additional risks arise. The municipality should continue to ensure that 
the appropriate, timely, effective, and agreed-upon risk responses are in place to manage these risks.
To help ensure alignment, all of the relevant stakeholders of the Compact Wind Turbine Project, 
including the municipality, the energy management department, local community members, and 
others, should agree on the risk responses. For example, the response to regulatory challenges 
should be suitable for the risk, implemented in a timely manner to effectively reduce the risk, and 
then agreed upon by all relevant stakeholders.
While the projects included in the case study face various negative risks or threats, they also present 
positive risks or opportunities. For example, the adaptable design of wind turbines could foster local 
innovation and promote global sustainability standards. By managing this risk effectively, the municipality 
can take advantage of this potential benefit and further align the project with its strategic objectives.

Risk Management Life Cycle in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
4.7 Implement Risk Responses
Once the planning of risk responses is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions 
should be included and defined in the relevant management plans. These actions may be delegated 
to response owners as appropriate. The risk owner monitors actions to determine their effectiveness 
and to identify any secondary risks that may arise because of the implementation of risk responses.
The risk owners and risk response owners should be briefed on any changes that may affect 
their responsibilities. Effective communication should be maintained between the risk owners 
and the portfolio, program, or project managers so that the designated stakeholders (a) accept 
accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of specific risks, (b) apply their best efforts to 
track the associated trigger conditions, and (c) carry out the agreed responses in a timely manner.
In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the 
effectiveness of the response should be provided as part of the risk response planning. The risk 
response owner should keep the risk owner aware of the status of the response actions. The risk 
owner should then decide whether the risk has been effectively dealt with or if additional actions 
should be planned and implemented. This ensures the agreed-upon actions are carried out within 
the normal portfolio, program, or project execution framework.
4.7.1 Purpose of Implement Risk Responses
The Implement Risk Responses process aims to carry out the agreed-upon risk response actions 
should the risk occur. Proper attention to the Implement Risk Responses process helps to ensure the 
agreed-upon risk responses are executed accordingly.
4.7.2 Key Success Factors for Implement Risk Responses
Success in achieving the objectives of the Implement Risk Responses process includes but is not 
limited to:
•	 Assigned risk ownership. Each identified risk should have an accountable owner who 
is responsible for its management. For instance, technical difficulties may be assigned to 
the project’s lead engineer, while regulatory challenges could fall under the jurisdiction of a 
compliance officer.
•	 Stakeholder commitment. It is essential that all stakeholders are on board with the planned 
risk responses.
•	 Effective communication management. Clear and regular communication helps to 
ensure that everyone is informed regarding risk management efforts. For instance, weekly risk 
management updates could be circulated among the project team, while monthly reports could 
be sent to a wider stakeholder group.
•	 Cost determination. The estimated costs of risk responses should be calculated and 
incorporated into the overall project planning. For instance, the cost of additional inspections to 
manage technical difficulties should be factored into the project budget.
•	 Availability of reserves. Adequate contingency and management reserves should be set 
aside to address any risks that materialize. For example, a contingency reserve could be allocated 
to cover potential cost escalations, while a management reserve may be used to address 
unforeseen regulatory challenges.

Case Study: Implementing Risk Responses in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
When a risk occurs in the Compact Wind Turbine Project, such as the design-inconsistency 
risk discussed earlier, the previously identified risk response owner (or owners) for the design 
inconsistencies should manage that risk.
All of the stakeholders responsible for implementing the risk response should be committed to 
ensuring that the risk is addressed as required. If the risk response involves altering the design of 
the turbines, the design team, materials suppliers, and potentially even local regulatory authorities 
should commit to implementing these changes.
To help ensure alignment among the stakeholders, effective communication should be in place, 
including risk management updates and reports that keep everyone informed about the risk 
management activities needed to address the design inconsistencies.
The municipality should keep track of the costs associated with addressing the design-inconsistency 
risk and should budget and plan for the risk to help ensure it is managed appropriately. If necessary, 
contingency and management reserves can be allocated to cover any potential cost escalations that 
may result from altering the design or materials, or the associated regulatory requirements that may 
arise.
4.8 Monitor Risks
The Monitor Risks process enables the portfolio, program, or project management team to 
reevaluate the status of previously identified risks; identify new emergent, secondary, and residual 
risks; and determine the effectiveness of the risk management processes.
The portfolio, program, or project environment may change as some risks occur, whether foreseen 
or unforeseen, and other risks become relevant or cease to be relevant. The management team 
should ensure the planning documents are kept current as additional information becomes 
available. Periodic risk reassessment using the risk management life cycle should be repeated at 
reasonable intervals or in response to relevant events.
In the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited 
prior to performing a risk reassessment.
In addition to regular status reviews, periodic risk audits should be performed to determine 
strengths and weaknesses in handling risks within the portfolio, program, or project. The audits 
entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or keys to success in risk management that could 
help improve the risk management of current or future portfolios, programs, or projects (see 
Figure 4-5).
At the end of the program or project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process 
should be carried out with a focus on long-term process improvements. This analysis consolidates 
lessons learned that are applicable to a large proportion of the organization’s future programs or 
projects, such as appropriate levels of resources, adequate time for the analysis, use of tools, level 
of detail, etc.

Risk Management Life Cycle in Portfolio, Program, and Project Management
The results of the risk management process audit are consolidated with specific information with 
respect to the experience of risk in the portfolio, program, or project. The results are highlighted, 
and potential future actions are proposed for applying them. These potential future actions may 
include any generally applicable guidelines for the organization, and the results can lead to an 
update of the corresponding organizational process assets.
4.8.1 Purpose of Monitor Risks
The primary objectives of the Monitor Risks process are to track identified risks and maintain the 
viability of response plans. In addition to tracking and managing the risk response actions, the 
effectiveness of all of the risk management processes should be periodically reviewed to provide 
improvements to the management of the current work as well as future work with an activity such as 
capturing lessons learned.
The corresponding set of trigger conditions is specified for each risk or set of risks for which a 
contingent response has been defined. The risk owner is responsible for ensuring that these 
conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as defined 
in a timely manner.
4.8.2 Key Success Factors for Monitor Risks
The key success factors for the monitoring of risks include but are not limited to:
•	 Integrated risk monitoring. It is essential to have a cohesive approach toward risk 
monitoring that integrates all areas of the project. For example, tracking technical difficulties 
should be coordinated with monitoring potential supply chain disruptions to help ensure a 
comprehensive view of the project’s risk landscape.

•	 Continuous monitoring of risk trigger conditions. Regularly assessing conditions that 
could trigger risks helps to preempt potential issues. Assessment involves a review of the defined 
potential causes to ensure they are still valid and/or to determine if new ones may have arisen.
•	 Maintaining risk awareness. An ongoing awareness of potential risks among all stakeholders 
can facilitate proactive risk management. Maintaining risk awareness could be achieved through 
regular risk management briefings to the project team, sponsors, steering committees, and wider 
stakeholder groups such as local community members and environmental sustainability advocates.
Case Study: Monitoring Risks in the Compact Wind Turbine Project
When a risk is identified in the Compact Wind Turbine Project, the municipality should work to 
ensure that the project takes a consistent approach toward monitoring that risk for all areas of 
the project. For instance, the team should closely monitor weather patterns to help prepare for 
any potential environmental uncertainties that may affect the installation of the turbines. The 
monitoring of this risk should include the assessment of any identified trigger conditions, such as a 
local weather alert, and should continuously review whether these conditions are accurate or if any 
new issues may arise.

Risk Management in the Context of Portfolio Management
5
Risk Management in the Context of 
Portfolio Management
Realizing the organization’s strategic objectives is the goal of risk management at the portfolio 
level, which aims to secure efficient and effective value delivery. Combining the management of 
opportunities and threats helps to achieve this goal.
At the portfolio level, risk management considers the entire organizational framework. A portfolio is a 
collection of subsidiary portfolios, programs, projects, and operations managed as a group to achieve 
strategic objectives. Risk management at the portfolio level ensures that all of the components 
implement consistent and effective processes to manage the entire risk management life cycle.
One of the main goals of portfolio management is to build a risk-efficient portfolio where the 
organization chooses to take an appropriate amount of risk within the portfolio to achieve the required 
value in the overall organizational strategy. Based on their contributions to the overall risk exposure 
and strategic importance, portfolio components are either added or removed to realize this goal.
5.1 Interconnectedness of Risks in  
Portfolios, Programs, and Projects
The intricacies of portfolio risk management become evident when considering that risks, programs, 
and projects are intertwined components of larger systems such as portfolios. This interconnectedness 
necessitates a comprehensive understanding and management of risks at various levels. This section 
explores the concept of risk efficiency in the context of portfolio risk management.
5.1.1 Risk Efficiency and Risk-Return Trade-Offs
Within the context of portfolios, risk efficiency is a powerful mechanism for attaining a harmonious 
balance between risk and reward. It is crucial to recognize that engaging in low-risk projects, while 
seemingly advantageous, could yield minimal rewards. This could potentially undermine the value of the 
investment made in a project within the portfolio. As a result, a minimum internal-return-on-investment 
threshold becomes evident, which needs to be achieved to make the project’s undertaking worthwhile 
within the portfolio.
In portfolio management, as a manager’s goal for bigger profits grows, the risk tied to the projects 
in the portfolio also increases. This suggests that there is a limit to how much risk is acceptable. This 
limit marks the point beyond which the risk of the projects in the portfolio gets too high, no matter 
how big the potential profits. So, the balance of risk and reward creates a range within the portfolio, 
from projects with low risk and low reward to those with high risk and high reward.

Case Study: Portfolio Management in the Context of the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
To illustrate, in the context of portfolio management for the municipality case study, consider the green 
portfolio. This portfolio aims to pursue environmentally friendly initiatives and includes diverse projects 
like an energy program, a public safety program, and a municipal carbon-footprint-tracking web 
application development project.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
As the municipality’s desire for larger benefits from this portfolio grows—combined with a desire 
for greater energy savings, an increase in carbon neutrality targets from the wind turbine project, 
increased safety from the public safety program, and more accurate carbon data from the app 
project—the risk associated with these projects also increases. There is a limit to how much risk the 
municipality can take on from these projects, beyond which the consequences of failure become 
too severe, regardless of the potential benefits.
For instance, a delay in the implementation of the wind turbine project could lead to a delay 
in energy savings and meeting goals. A flaw in the public safety program could result in 
ineffective measures for improving the municipality’s safety goals. An error in the carbon-
data-tracking project could cause incorrect data collection and usage, potentially leading to 
incorrect decisions.
This balance of risk and reward creates a spectrum within the green portfolio, ranging from 
projects with low risk and low reward, like minor updates to the public safety program, to those 
with high risk and high reward, such as implementing an entirely new wind turbine project. 
This spectrum helps the town decide how to allocate resources and manage the projects in 
its portfolio.
5.1.2 Risk Exposure in Portfolios
A portfolio can comprise a diverse mix of subsidiary portfolios, programs, projects, and business-
as-usual operations. Within such a portfolio, maintaining a balance of risk exposures is key. This 
includes engaging in low-risk projects that assure predictable outcomes (albeit with minimal 
rewards) and high-risk projects that provide the potential for significant returns (accompanied 
by higher risk levels). To achieve a risk-efficient portfolio, it should neither be overly exposed to 
excessive risk nor underexposed, which would limit the potential rewards.
5.1.3 Role of Portfolio Manager
The efficacy of a risk-efficient strategy hinges mainly on the portfolio manager’s ability to accurately 
gauge each portfolio component’s inherent riskiness. Determining the expected rewards is a 
comparatively straightforward task, given that these are derived from the predicted benefits and 
objectives of the programs and projects. However, computing the overall portfolio’s risk exposure 
necessitates a consistent risk assessment process. For a more detailed explanation on the role of the 
portfolio manager, in general, refer to The Standard for Portfolio Management [3].
5.1.4 Risk-Efficient Boundary and Organizational Strategy
An organization’s overarching strategy and its risk appetite significantly influence the risk-efficient 
boundary (i.e., defining acceptable levels of risk and reward based on the expected effectiveness 
of the risk treatment). Alterations to key strategies will invariably cause shifts in risk exposure, 
necessitating subsequent readjustments in the portfolio components.
Managing risk in the portfolio is not something that is done as frequently as in projects due to the 
longer timeframes of portfolios. This widens the life cycle of risk management.

Risk Management in the Context of Portfolio Management
Case Study: The Risk-Efficient Boundary in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
For instance, the wind turbine project or the public safety program could take years to complete. 
As a result, adjustments to the portfolio, such as adding or removing projects, may only happen 
once or twice a year.
Still, it is crucial for the municipality to regularly and consistently assess the risks associated with 
the components in the portfolio and how well they match the expected balance of risk and reward. 
For example, if the wind turbine project faces significant delays and cost overruns, it may no longer 
align with the municipality’s risk-reward expectations. Regular check-ins can help ensure the 
portfolio’s health and determine if it is still helping the municipality meet its green objectives and 
carbon neutrality targets.
5.1.5 Emerging Trends in Portfolio Risk Management
The continuous evolution and understanding of risk management can offer interesting insights into 
new application areas and potential contributions to various disciplines. Portfolio management is an 
emerging field that promises innovative applications and further developments in risk management 
approaches.
There are several emerging trends in portfolio risk management:
•	 Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Both AI and ML are increasingly 
being used to predict and manage portfolio risks. Advanced algorithms can analyze large 
amounts of information from previous portfolios, programs, and projects using their internal 
databases as well as external, real-world data within the public domain. This use of advanced 
algorithms enables risk managers to identify patterns more quickly and accurately. These 
tools can help portfolio managers identify hidden risks, anticipate market changes, and make 
more informed decisions. (Note: This practice guide is meant to be read in general terms. 
There are many other publications and case studies available to become more familiar with 
how AI works.)
•	 Robotic process automation (RPA). RPA can be a powerful tool for portfolio risk 
management, enhancing efficiency and accuracy while minimizing human error. RPA aids in 
automating risk identification and assessment by scanning portfolio components’ data and 
flagging potential issues based on predefined criteria, enabling early mitigation. Furthermore, 
it facilitates continuous monitoring of key project indicators and generates automatic risk 
reports, aiding proactive risk management. RPA can also streamline risk prioritization across the 
portfolio components by processing extensive risk data and categorizing the risks based on their 
potential impact, optimizing resource utilization. Additionally, RPA can assist in implementing 
response plans and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations, thus reducing the risk of 
noncompliance.
•	 Cyber risk management. As digital transformation accelerates, managing cyber risk has 
become crucial to portfolio risk management. Understanding and managing these cyber risks is 
essential, as any cyber threat could seriously impact the performance of the portfolio.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
•	 Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk management. Portfolio managers 
are increasingly incorporating ESG risk assessments into their risk management strategies, 
looking at environmental factors like a company’s carbon footprint, social impact, and corporate 
governance practices. There is growing recognition that ESG factors can significantly impact the 
requirements of a project and, subsequently, a portfolio’s performance.
•	 Stress testing and scenario analysis. In reaction to economic uncertainties, the use 
of stress testing and scenario analysis is gaining traction in portfolio management. These 
techniques can aid portfolio managers in anticipating how their portfolios may fare under 
different challenging conditions.
•	 Integrated risk management. Although not necessarily emerging, integrated risk 
management is being more widely applied, which necessitates a comprehensive view of all 
of the risks across a portfolio and their interactions. Understanding these interconnected 
risks provides a more accurate assessment of the portfolio’s overall risk profile. This holistic 
view enables managers to develop more robust risk mitigation strategies that account for the 
interplays among different projects within the portfolio.
Case Study: Incorporating Emerging Trends in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
In the Compact Wind Turbine Project, the municipality wants to ensure that they are considering the 
impact of the portfolio on the community as well as incorporating some of the emerging tools and 
techniques available to assist with their risk management efforts.
The municipality is exploring the use of AI and ML to support data analysis and the making of 
informed decisions. The use of AI and ML will assist in finding patterns in the portfolio more quickly 
and accurately, which can help to identify hidden risks, monitor risk indicators, and make more 
informed decisions using data from previous portfolios, programs, and projects. The use of RPA will 
help categorize any identified risks based on their potential impact, which can help to determine 
how resources should be allocated in the portfolio.
The municipality is also embracing digital transformation, particularly through projects like the 
carbon data app in its green portfolio. Managing cyber risk has become a vital aspect of the 
municipality’s portfolio management. The municipality’s portfolio managers need to evaluate 
the cybersecurity measures in place for their projects, especially those with significant digital 
components. For instance, the carbon data app project will require robust cybersecurity measures 
to protect the collected and processed data from potential cyber threats. Understanding and 
managing these cyber risks is essential, as any cyber threat could seriously impact the performance 
of the portfolio (e.g., a cyber breach in the carbon data app could disrupt operations and 
negatively affect public trust in the municipality’s initiatives, potentially derailing other projects in 
the portfolio).
The portfolio manager, who is overseeing the municipality’s green portfolio, is progressively 
incorporating ESG risk assessments into the risk management strategy. For instance, the portfolio 
manager may consider the environmental impact of wind turbines and other similar projects within

Risk Management in the Context of Portfolio Management
the initiative that directly address the portfolio’s carbon footprint. The portfolio manager should 
evaluate the social impact of projects and programs like the public safety program, which aims 
to improve safety and well-being in the community. The portfolio manager may also scrutinize 
governance practices, such as how decisions are made for the carbon data app project, ensuring 
transparency and accountability.
The municipality’s green portfolio manager may perform a stress test on the wind turbine project to 
see how it would cope with unexpected changes in funding or significant increases in material costs. 
Scenario analysis could be used for the public safety program, examining its resilience in various 
situations, like a rise in local crime rates or a natural disaster. For the carbon data app project, the 
municipality may explore scenarios related to data security breaches or sudden shifts in regulatory 
requirements. Understanding these potential scenarios helps the portfolio manager to make 
necessary adjustments, reinforcing the resilience of the portfolio against diverse adverse conditions.
An integrated risk management approach could become increasingly relevant for the municipality’s 
green portfolio. By adopting this approach, the portfolio manager can understand how the risks 
associated with the wind turbine project, for example, may impact the public safety program or the 
carbon data app project. For instance, if the wind turbine project runs over budget, it may affect the 
available funds for other projects. Alternatively, if the carbon data app project faces a data breach, it 
may impact public trust and participation in the public safety program.
It is in the interest of the municipality to take these emerging considerations into account and to 
evaluate new tools and techniques to help ensure that the portfolio is implementing a robust yet 
measured approach to their risk management activities.
5.2 Portfolio Risk Management Life Cycle
The risk management life cycle, as described in Section 4, generally applies to portfolio 
management. Several additional considerations for the corresponding processes should be 
considered in this context, as outlined in this section.
5.2.1 Portfolio Risk Identification
Risk identification at the portfolio level is focused on (a) identifying the risks that have an impact 
on the delivery of the expected business performance and (b) the ability of the organization to 
implement its strategy and achieve its strategic objectives.
There are two levels of risk:
•	 Strategic risks. Strategic risks are identified directly at the portfolio level and triggered by 
portfolio activities. Strategic risks include activities related to business performance by the 
portfolio components and those impacting the organization’s ability to achieve its strategic 
objectives.
•	 Tactical risks. Tactical risks are short-term risks that are either raised by management 
procedures at the portfolio level or originate from the portfolio’s components.

68
Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
Risks that can impact portfolio components typically include the following categories:
•	 Changing business needs, environment, or context;
•	 Availability of resources;
•	 Interactions among components; and
•	 Conflicting component objectives.
Case Study: Strategic-Level Portfolio Risks in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
Based on the definition of strategic-level risks, and reviewing the case study provided in Section 4, 
here are a few examples that could be considered strategic-level portfolio risks:
•	 Market volatility. Changes in market conditions, such as fluctuations in energy prices or shifts 
in government policies, can impact the financial viability of the wind turbine portfolio.
•	 Regulatory changes. Shifts in regulations or policies related to renewable energy and 
sustainability could introduce compliance risks or alter the economic incentives for the portfolio.
•	 Technology obsolescence. Rapid advancements in wind turbine technology could render 
the existing portfolio outdated or less competitive, leading to potential obsolescence risks.
•	 Investment viability. The portfolio may face a risk related to the financial viability of 
the Compact Wind Turbine Project. Factors such as budget constraints, cost escalations, or 
inadequate return on investment could impact the overall business performance and the 
portfolio’s ability to achieve its strategic objectives.
•	 Reputation and public perception. The municipality’s reputation and public perception 
could be at risk if the Compact Wind Turbine Project faces challenges, controversies, or negative 
impacts on the environment or local communities. Maintaining a positive reputation is crucial for 
achieving strategic objectives and ensuring ongoing support for sustainability initiatives.
5.2.2 Portfolio Risk Qualitative and Quantitative Analyses
The evaluation of risks at the portfolio level is performed by considering the impact of risks on the 
realization of the expected business performance or the execution of the organizational strategy. 
One of the reasons these analyses are conducted is to evaluate whether the level of impact can be 
contained within the scope of the portfolio manager’s accountability.
When the impact affects the portfolio’s business performance or strategic objectives, then the 
impact is typically addressed at the portfolio level operationally. When the impact affects the ability 
of the organization to execute strategy and realize the intended value, the risk—and responsibility 
to respond to the risk—are escalated to a higher governance level.

69
Risk Management in the Context of Portfolio Management
Case Study: Portfolio Risk Analyses in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
In the case study, for example, evaluating risks at the portfolio level involves assessing the 
effect of these risks on the expected performance of the municipality’s green initiatives or the 
overall environmental strategy. The purpose of these assessments is to determine whether the 
impact of these risks falls within the responsibility of the portfolio managers overseeing the 
green portfolio.
For example, if a risk, such as a delay in the wind turbine project, affects the performance of 
the green portfolio, this risk would typically be managed tactically at the portfolio level. The 
portfolio managers may respond by adjusting project timelines, reallocating resources, or 
revising project objectives.
However, if the impact of a risk, such as a major budget overrun or a significantly negative 
public response to the carbon data app, threatens the municipality’s ability to execute its 
broader environmental strategy and realize the intended value of its green initiatives, the risk 
and the responsibility to address it would be escalated to a higher governance level such as 
the city council or the mayor’s office. The risk would then be managed at this higher level, 
potentially involving strategic decisions like revising the overall portfolio or the municipality’s 
broader strategy.
5.2.3 Portfolio Risk Response Strategies
In portfolio risk management, risk responses focus on exploiting business opportunities and 
maximizing value creation for the organization and its stakeholders. It goes beyond treating threats, 
which, at the portfolio level, are merely limitations to actions. Portfolio management also includes 
responding to risks escalated by its components to ensure that these are effectively and efficiently 
addressed at the appropriate level.
In principle, all the potential responses listed in Section 4 can be used when responding to risks at 
the portfolio level.
The risk response strategies developed at the portfolio level consist of the activities documented 
in the portfolio risk management plan. In addition, some responses are developed because of 
escalation at the component level. These activities are budgeted accordingly and funded from the 
relevant sources. Examples of relevant funding sources are the portfolio or component’s budget for 
preventive responses, relevant contingency reserves for handling occurrences of known risks, or 
management reserves for handling unforeseen risk-related issues.
Risk responses can be planned as additional portfolio components such as subsidiary portfolios, 
programs, projects, or elements of the portfolio governance framework. These components 
are aimed at maximizing business performance or enhancing the execution of organizational 
strategy to achieve strategic objectives. In some cases, the risk response can also lead to removing 
components from the portfolio.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
5.2.4 Implementing Portfolio Risk Responses
The implementation of risk responses within a portfolio includes:
•	 Triggering risk responses as they have been defined in the portfolio risk management plan,
•	 Transferring the corresponding budget from the management and contingency reserves into 
the budget at completion, and
•	 Updating the portfolio baselines accordingly.
The risk responses planned as new components become part of the portfolio and are subject to the 
application of the standard portfolio delivery and deployment processes.
Any formally approved risk response is integral to the portfolio management plan. Implementing 
such a response is not a change to the portfolio initiated through a formal portfolio change 
management procedure. However, any new responses planned to address emergent risks become 
part of the portfolio change management procedure.
5.2.5 Monitoring Portfolio Risks
Monitoring risks at the portfolio level is both a strategic and tactical activity, described as follows:
•	 Strategic activity. Monitoring risks strategically addresses the evolution of the risk 
characteristics of each portfolio component, the overall portfolio risk profile, and the impact of 
that evolution on business performance. The focus is on the development and implementation 
of the organizational strategy and the achievement of strategic objectives. These risk profiles 
are regularly analyzed in order to identify any potential trends that may indicate new risks or 
the inefficiency or ineffectiveness of the response strategies. The monitoring of risk responses 
is conducted according to quantitative parameters and qualitative assessments. These risk 
responses are intended to effectively treat the specific risk they are addressing to enhance 
or maintain the realization of the expected business performance and the execution of the 
organizational strategy. The qualitative assessment is performed by revising the risk analysis 
to ensure these plans are efficient and effective. Finally, it is critical to ensure the portfolio’s 
components are properly implemented and that effective, risk-related elements of the 
governance framework are part of the monitoring of risks at the portfolio level.
•	 Tactical activity. Monitoring risks tactically oversees the aspects related to the execution 
of the anticipatory and responsive actions undertaken to respond to identified risks. Tactical 
monitoring also ensures that operational or systemic risks that could impact the portfolio are 
properly handled.
5.3 Integration of Risk Management into the  
Portfolio Management Performance Domains
In order to achieve the portfolio objectives, several risk management practices can be applied 
across the portfolio life cycle within all of the performance domains (see Figure 5-1). These practices 
typically cover the areas shown in Table 5-1.

Portfolio Strategic Management
The essence of Portfolio Strategic Management is to ensure 
the enhancement or exploitation of strategic opportunities and 
the avoidance or mitigation of threats that could potentially 
prevent the organization from achieving its full potential. 
Therefore, risk management in the context of portfolio strategic 
management focuses on identifying and actively managing 
those opportunities and threats that could substantially 
impact the realization of the organizational strategy. 
Portfolio Governance
The purpose of Portfolio Governance is to ensure that the 
portfolio is managed in an appropriate way. This includes 
meeting the legal, regulatory, and organizational governance 
requirements. The role of risk management within portfolio 
governance is to use the organization’s potential to (a) 
efﬁciently secure adequate governance and management 
practices and (b) avoid or address threats that could lead to 
misconduct or ineffective management of the portfolio. 
Portfolio Capacity and Capability Management
Risk management in the context of Portfolio Capacity and 
Capability Management focuses on the mutual impact of the 
portfolio and related operations. In addition, risk management 
in the context of capacity and capability management ensures 
the proper use and development of capital and assets 
entrusted to the portfolio manager for the component 
programs and projects. 
Portfolio Stakeholder Engagement
Key stakeholders at the portfolio level typically include 
executive leaders and managers of the organization and their 
equivalents in the key partner, supplier, and customer 
organizations. Another key group of stakeholders is the 
component managers. From this perspective, portfolio risk 
management focuses on (a) opportunities to increase the 
effectiveness of realizing the organization’s strategy and (b) 
threats that could potentially lower the ability to do so.
Portfolio Value Management
Portfolio Value Management focuses on ensuring that the 
investment in portfolio components leads to the delivery of 
expected value. In this context, risk management focuses on 
(a) maximizing opportunities to increase the value delivered 
and (b) responding to threats that could potentially lower the 
value or probability of value delivery. 
Portfolio Risk Management
Portfolio Risk Management focuses on ensuring that risk at the 
portfolio and its component levels is recognized and managed 
effectively. It is achieved through risk management and 
governance practices. Because these practices are essential 
for dealing with uncertainty at the portfolio level, they are also 
analyzed from a risk perspective. Adequate measures are then 
taken to ensure that the application of risk management is 
robust and effective.

Risk Management in the Context of Program Management
6
Risk Management in the Context of 
Program Management
Risk management in program management is a strategic effort aimed at optimizing program 
benefits while navigating complexity, addressing potential threats, and seizing opportunities. This 
strategic effort involves the integrated management of both positive and negative risks.
Programs comprise a collection of interconnected projects, subsidiary programs, and coordinated 
activities. This program-level coordination generates benefits that are unattainable when such 
components are managed in isolation. Additionally, programs include operational activities related to 
completed program components, which can generate or be influenced by risks. Thus, risk management 
ensures efficient processes for managing the entire risk life cycle of these program components.
6.1 Distinctions and Challenges in Program Risk Management
The primary goal of program risk management is to address uncertainties that may impact program 
objectives. This distinction is crucial, as programs have different strategic focuses and desired 
outcomes compared to individual projects. Acknowledging these differences and implementing 
appropriate risk management approaches helps organizations overcome program-specific 
uncertainties, align with strategic goals, and enhance program success.
6.1.1 Understanding Program Risk Management
As indicated earlier, risk management at the program level is strategic, aiming to optimize benefits 
while mitigating threats and uncertainties and taking advantage of opportunities. Programs, due 
to their complex nature, blend various projects and subsidiary programs, resulting in synergistic 
benefits when managed holistically (see Figure 6-1).
6.1.2 Sources, Nature, and Types of Program Risks
Programs face multifaceted risks from individual projects, the portfolio level, and internal 
complexities. Furthermore, risks can be categorized via projects, program-level coordination, 
overarching program aspects, and strategic-level decisions. Risks also can be classified as overall 
(affecting the entire program) and individual (specific events or conditions influencing individual 
components). Risks can be categorized as follows:
•	 Risks escalating from projects. Some project risks may exceed project-level scope and 
require program-level management, stemming from factors like scope changes, delays, resource 
limitations, technical difficulties, or stakeholder conflicts. Diligent monitoring and evaluation of 
key project risks are essential to respond to escalation and help ensure program success.
•	 Emerging risks at the program level. These risks involve coordination, resource allocation, 
dependency management, and technology sharing among program components. They also could 
pertain to program management, execution, control, reporting, alignment with strategic objectives, 
and changes in requirements. Managing these overarching risks is crucial for program success.
•	 Risks cascading from the portfolio and strategic levels. Changes in organizational 
strategies, policies, or external factors can introduce new risks or alter the existing risk landscape 
for programs. Identifying and assessing these strategic-level risks, staying informed about the 
organization’s direction, and engaging with stakeholders are essential for proactive risk management.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
6.1.3. Bridging the Risk Management Gaps among  
the Portfolio, Program, and Project Levels
Risk management plays a critical role in an organization’s success, especially when dealing with risks 
across various levels of portfolios, programs, and projects. Effectively bridging the risk management 
gaps among these levels can pose significant challenges. By comprehending and proactively 
addressing these gaps, organizations can strengthen their capacity to navigate uncertainties, 
optimize resource allocation, and confidently achieve their strategic objectives. The integration of 
risk management practices across these different levels empowers organizations to make informed 
decisions, address potential threats, and capitalize on opportunities, ultimately leading to improved 
overall performance and success.
These risk management practices include:
•	 Establishing risk thresholds. To ensure efficient risk management, it is essential to 
establish a program risk threshold that determines whether a risk should be managed at the 
program or project level. This risk threshold is determined based on the level of impact and 
severity a risk may have. Consistency in assessing risks across different program components 
is vital. Techniques like expected monetary value (EMV) or risk scores, derived from probability 
and impact assessments, can be utilized. Another technique to consider is analyzing the 
Portfolio Level (Strategic)
Program Level
Project and Other
Components Level
(Tactical)

Risk Management in the Context of Program Management
program-level schedule impacts of a project-level risk being realized (e.g., a delay in one project 
resulting in a cascade effect impacting the timelines of multiple other projects in the program). 
Understanding the risk threshold and maintaining a consistent approach in evaluating risks 
can be challenging, but is crucial for distinguishing between program-level and project-level 
risks, based on predefined thresholds. By adhering to these predetermined criteria, program 
managers can allocate appropriate resources and attention to defined levels of risk, enabling 
them to address potential issues more effectively and ensure the overall success of the program.
•	 Dealing with cumulative risks. Cumulative risks arise when risks are interconnected or 
stem from the same source. Managing these risks at the program level is crucial. Breakdown 
structures, such as risk, work, and organizational breakdown structures, can aid in identifying 
common categories, groupings, and patterns among risks. By mapping risks against these 
structures, insights into the relationships among risks can be gained. For instance, risks that 
impact the same work package, or are related to work packages across programs or projects, 
can be grouped together. Additionally, risks originating from the same source within the risk 
breakdown structure can be cumulated. By addressing cumulative risks collectively, program 
managers can develop more comprehensive and efficient risk response strategies, ensuring 
that potential impacts are appropriately managed and the overall success of the program 
is safeguarded.
•	 Addressing risks cascading from the portfolio and strategic levels. Risks emanating 
from higher levels, such as the board of directors or senior executives, can have substantial 
repercussions for the portfolio and its associated programs. These strategic and portfolio risks may 
arise from policy decisions, market positioning, competitive advantage, or portfolio components 
prioritization. To manage these risks effectively, it is essential to establish a strategy-to-portfolio-
to-program risk threshold. This threshold helps in determining when strategic and portfolio 
risks demand attention at the program level. Clear communication channels and transparent 
discussions with the board or senior and portfolio managers are vital for effectively addressing 
these risks. By maintaining open lines of communication, program managers can gain valuable 
insights into strategic and high-level decisions and their potential impacts on the programs. 
Proactively managing these risks at the program level ensures better alignment with the 
organization’s strategic vision and enhances the overall chances of success for the entire program.
•	 Managing program-level risks. Program-level risks are unique to the program. It is crucial 
to openly discuss and address program-level risks to ensure their proper handling and minimize 
any potential negative impact on the program’s success. By proactively managing these risks at 
the program level, program managers can maintain better control over the program’s trajectory, 
optimize resource allocation, and enhance the program’s overall resilience. This comprehensive 
approach to risk management bolsters the program’s chance of achieving its intended objectives 
and delivering value.
Programs involve a multitude of elements, business-as-usual activities, and related initiatives, 
leading to distinctive risks that emerge from internal processes, components, and interactions. 
These risks are shaped by various factors such as the program’s structure, scope, stakeholders, 
resource allocation, and dependencies among program components. It is crucial to identify and 
address these program-specific risks through the implementation of customized risk assessment, 
response, and control measures. This implementation involves conducting comprehensive risk 
assessments, formulating robust risk response strategies, and establishing rigorous risk monitoring 
and control mechanisms integrated into the program management framework. By diligently 
addressing these program-level risks, program managers can enhance the program’s overall 
resilience and increase its likelihood of achieving desired outcomes.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
Note: Risk level refers to the magnitude of a specific risk event or potential impact on a project or 
organization. Risk level concentrates on assessing the severity or significance of individual risks, 
and is often measured in terms of likelihood and impact, helping to prioritize risks based on their 
potential consequences. Alternatively, a risk profile provides a comprehensive overview of all 
risks associated with a portfolio, program, project, or organization. A risk profile typically includes 
information about individual risks, such as their likelihood, impact, response strategies, and overall 
exposure, to enable stakeholders to understand the overall risk landscape and make informed 
decisions about risk management priorities and strategies.
6.1.4 Managing Program Overall and Individual Risks
Managing program-level risks necessitates a unique and comprehensive strategy due to their 
broader scope and complexity. Unlike project-level risk management, addressing program-level 
risks requires an interconnected approach that considers strategic alignment between the program 
management plan and organizational strategy, with consideration to the environmental factors 
found in the environmental assessments. This approach includes defining program risk management 
goals; identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing risks; conducting quantitative analysis; developing 
customized responses; implementing risk response strategies; regularly reviewing and updating risk 
management plans; and maintaining effective communication and reporting practices.
Distinguishing between overall and individual program risk management, alongside the concept of 
risk efficiency, provides a strategic framework to manage risks within programs. Managing overall 
risks involves understanding the impact of uncertainties on the entire program and focusing on risk 
exposure arising from the program’s inherent elements such as its structure and scope. Conversely, 
managing individual risks concentrates on specific uncertain events or conditions that could 
positively or negatively affect the program’s objectives.
Program-level risks are generally classified into escalated risks and cascaded risks. Escalated risks 
originate from lower levels within the program such as project-based risks, which, when combined, 
can significantly impact the program. Alternatively, cascaded risks stem from strategic decisions made 
by higher management or at the portfolio level, which could also affect the program (see Figure 6-2).
To achieve risk efficiency, programs should aim for a balanced group of projects and activities with 
varied risk-reward profiles. This balancing involves strategically selecting and combining projects 
with diverse levels of risk to optimize the risk profile and efficiency within the program. Building 
a risk-efficient program entails carefully evaluating and selecting projects and activities that align 
with the program’s objectives and risk thresholds, and involves considering potential returns, 
resource allocation, interdependencies, and the impact on strategic goals to create a well-rounded 
and successful program.
6.1.5 Achieving Flexibility and Resilience in Program Risk Management
Flexibility and resilience are vital to a program’s risk management strategy. By designing a program 
with inherent flexibility, program managers can make necessary adjustments to manage overall risk 
exposure effectively. Structuring the program into phases enhances resilience, allowing incremental 
delivery while addressing risks proactively. Program risk management operates at both the overall 
and individual levels. Both levels are interrelated, influencing each other. A comprehensive strategy, 
employing standard risk management tools adapted to the program level, strengthens resilience 
and improves risk management results.

Risk Management in the Context of Program Management
6.1.6 Program Risk Management Implementation Challenges
Implementing program risk management presents several challenges, including but not limited to:
•	 Distinguishing between overall and individual risks. Programs face two types of risks: 
overall and individual. Managing overall risk exposure requires distinct strategies from those 
used for handling individual risks, making it essential to address both aspects separately in an 
effective program risk management plan. For instance, in a program developing a new product 
line, the overall risk may be related to market demand. Significant changes in market conditions 
could impact the entire program’s success. At the same time, individual risks within the program 
could include delays in developing specific components due to technical challenges or resource 
constraints. Similarly, in a program expanding business operations into a new region, the 
overall risk may be associated with changes in regulatory requirements, affecting multiple 
projects within the program. At the individual level, one project in the program may face a risk 
related to securing necessary permits for construction in a specific location. It is also crucial 
to identify controllable and uncontrollable risks. Controllable risks are those whose causes 
can be proactively addressed, while uncontrollable risks, like weather conditions, are beyond 
organizations’ control, necessitating planned actions to mitigate their effects. Practitioners 
often focus solely on dealing with effects, neglecting to address underlying causes. Awareness 
of controllable risks and the development of proactive action plans to address their causes are

key to successful risk management. By recognizing and addressing both overall and individual 
risks appropriately, program managers can ensure comprehensive risk management and 
enhance the program’s chance of success. It is also important to consider the influence of the 
uncertainty and ambiguity of the client’s requirements, technology innovation and continuous 
disequilibrium, and the evolving nature of the organization’s programs.
•	 Building program risk efficiency. A significant challenge lies in establishing a consistent 
method for measuring risk and return across the program’s projects and components. To ensure 
meaningful comparison and evaluation of risks, a standard approach is necessary. This approach 
aims to achieve risk efficiency, which involves optimizing the return for a given level of risk.
•	 Identifying the risk baseline. A risk baseline helps in identifying, documenting, assessing, and 
managing risks, as it provides a structured framework for understanding and addressing potential 
challenges and uncertainties throughout the program’s life cycle. It represents a snapshot or 
a point-in-time record of identified risks, their attributes, and their associated information at a 
specific moment in the program’s life cycle. The risk baseline serves several important purposes:
	
o	 Risk identification. Risk identification documents all identified risks that could potentially 
impact the program.
	
o	 Risk description. Each risk in the baseline should have a detailed description, including its 
nature, source, potential consequences, and the factors contributing to its existence.
	
o	 Risk ownership. The risk baseline often assigns ownership of each risk to a specific 
individual or team responsible for responding to and managing each risk. This ownership 
ensures accountability for addressing and responding to risks.
	
o	 Risk assessment and prioritization. Risks in the baseline are typically assessed in terms 
of their probability (likelihood of occurrence) and impact (severity of consequences). This 
assessment helps prioritize which risks require the most attention and resources.
	
o	 Risk response strategies. The baseline may include initial strategies or plans for 
managing each risk or other recommendations, especially for cascading risks. These strategies 
can evolve over time as the program progresses and more information becomes available.
	
o	 Monitoring and tracking. The risk baseline serves as a reference point for monitoring 
changes in risks over time. As the program advances, new risks may emerge, while existing 
risks may evolve or be dealt with. Changes to the baseline are documented and tracked.
	
o	 Communication. The risk baseline provides a means for effective communication among 
program stakeholders.
	
o	 Baseline comparison. The baseline enables comparisons of the current risk baseline 
to previous versions to assess how the program risk landscape is changing and how risk is 
escalating from program components. This comparison helps in making informed decisions 
and adjustments to the risk management strategies.
	
o	 Risk reporting. Information from the risk baseline is often included in program status 
reports to keep stakeholders informed about the state of risk management activities.
Risk baselines and benchmarks play a crucial role in finding the optimal balance between risk 
and return or impact. By evaluating the potential advantages and disadvantages of high-risk 
components within the program, program managers can optimize the overall risk exposure while 
still ensuring that strategic goals are met. This comprehensive approach aids in making informed 
decisions and achieving the best possible outcomes for the program.

Risk Management in the Context of Program Management
•	 Aligning with organizational risk management framework. Program risk management 
should be aligned with organizational risk management to account for the organization’s unique 
risk threshold levels and objectives. By considering the organization’s specific circumstances and 
strategic goals, program managers can effectively address risks in a manner that aligns with the 
broader organizational vision. However, aligning program risk management with organizational 
risk management poses various challenges. These challenges may include differences in 
risk cultures, communication and collaboration needs, complexities in process integration, 
considerations of organizational structure, resource allocation requirements, and efforts related to 
change management. Overcoming these challenges is vital to ensuring a cohesive and harmonious 
approach to risk management that enhances the organization’s overall resilience and success.
•	 Continual program risk monitoring and adjustment. Achieving risk efficiency is an 
iterative and continuous process that demands constant monitoring of risks throughout the 
program life cycle. The process involves identifying, assessing, and responding to risks in a 
manner that adapts to the program’s evolution and external changes. Regular reassessment 
ensures that risk management strategies remain aligned with the program’s current state and 
environment—accommodating new risks, changes in known risks, or the retirement of irrelevant 
risks. Based on these reassessments, adjustments are made, such as revising response plans, 
reallocating resources, or updating the program’s risk profile. This ongoing process maintains 
an optimal risk-return balance, bolstering the program’s resilience, flexibility, and likelihood of 
achieving its objectives amid the ever-changing landscape of risks and uncertainties. Continuous 
monitoring and adaptation are essential to equip the program to navigate challenges and 
seize opportunities throughout its life cycle. By staying proactive and responsive, the program 
can effectively manage risks, ensuring that it remains on track to meet its strategic goals. 
This dynamic approach to risk management maximizes the program’s ability to succeed in a 
constantly evolving environment, enhancing its overall performance and outcomes.
•	 Tailoring risk management approaches. Managing risks at the program level requires a 
strategic mindset, where program managers should grasp the program’s strategic objectives and 
broader context. This shift involves moving away from a focus solely on project deliverables and 
constraints to instead aligning actions with organizational objectives to address higher-level 
risks. It is crucial to consider factors such as the overall program strategy, stakeholder alignment, 
and long-term benefits. Additionally, different program types, such as strategic, operational, 
and compliance programs, come with their own unique characteristics and risk considerations. 
As a result, risk management approaches should be tailored to each program type’s distinct risk 
exposures. Taking this holistic view ensures a robust risk management framework that integrates 
strategic objectives with tailored, program-specific considerations, leading to more effective risk 
management and successful program outcomes.
•	 Risk management integration. Integrating risk management into the overall program 
management is of the utmost importance. This integration involves coordinating and 
communicating among risk management and other program management functions to ensure 
a cohesive approach. Making risk-informed decisions is vital for effective program management, 
and implementing a continuous monitoring and evaluation process helps in staying proactive.
At the program level, risks encompass both project-specific risks and risks associated with other 
program components that demand attention and proper responses at this level. Furthermore, it is 
essential to incorporate risks stemming from strategic and portfolio-level changes and program-
level interface risks into the risk management process. Considering all these aspects creates a 
comprehensive program risk management framework that enhances the program’s resilience and 
contributes to achieving its objectives.

6.2 Program Risk Management Life Cycle
The risk management life cycle, as described in Section 4, is generally applicable to program 
management. However, there are several additional considerations specific to the program 
management context that should be taken into account.
6.2.1 Program Risk Identification
Risk identification at the program level focuses on identifying the risks that could impact the 
delivery of expected benefits. It also focuses on the organization’s ability to take over and use the 
results of the components that are part of the program’s scope.
There are three levels where risks relevant to the program can be identified:
•	 Risks cascading from the portfolio or enterprise level that can affect the achievement of program 
objectives;
•	 Risks identified directly at the program level and triggered by program activities, their 
interdependencies, and activities related to the integration of the components’ results to 
generate the expected benefits; and
•	 Risks escalated from the program components.
Case Study: Program Management in the Context of the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
Based on the case study of the municipality’s green portfolio, we can identify several program-
level risks that are associated with the energy program, the public safety program, and the carbon 
data app project, which is a component in the portfolio that interacts with other programs and 
components. These risks arise directly from program activities, their interdependencies, and the 
integration of various components to deliver expected benefits.
Some case study examples where risks may cascade down from the green portfolio or overall 
municipal level and could affect achieving the program’s objectives include:
•	 Interdependency risk. The Compact Wind Turbine Project is interconnected with other 
projects within the energy program. If there is a delay or failure in any of these interconnected 
projects, it may jeopardize the timely completion and success of the entire program. For 
instance, a delay in procuring materials for the wind turbines can impact the construction 
timeline, and thus, the overall program schedule.
•	 Benefit realization risk. The public safety program aims to enhance safety and security. 
If the implemented measures do not effectively reduce accidents associated with the green 
portfolio, or if they are not accepted or used correctly by the public, the expected benefits of 
the program will not be realized. This is a risk tied directly to program activities and their desired 
outcomes. In this case, the benefit realization risk from the public safety program could be 
escalated to the portfolio level. Materialization of this risk necessitates program completion and 
closure of program-level risks. Upon escalation, the portfolio manager becomes responsible for 
its management, potentially initiating mitigating actions to be implemented by the program

Risk Management in the Context of Program Management
manager. This underscores a strategic shift from managing program-specific risks to addressing 
broader, portfolio-wide concerns.
•	 Cross-program risk. There is a risk that the energy generated by the Compact Wind 
Turbine Project may not meet the power needs of the public safety program or other programs 
or portfolios within the municipality, jeopardizing its operations. This risk is tied to the 
interdependency of results from different programs within the portfolio.
The program risks are identified from their operational and contextual perspectives:
•	 Operational risks. Risks at the operational level are directly triggered by program activities 
such as integration of the results of projects and their related transition, change management, 
and triggering of operational activities. In addition, some operational risks may result from 
the escalation of the components’ risks when these risks have an impact that expands beyond 
the perimeter of accountability of the component managers or their specific budgets. For 
example, the portfolio’s stand-alone carbon data app project aims to monitor and manage 
the municipality’s carbon footprint. If the data from the energy program (like the wind turbine 
energy production) and the public safety program (like the carbon footprint of security 
infrastructure) are not accurately integrated into the app within the proper timeframe, it may 
lead to incorrect carbon footprint calculations, thereby not achieving the expected benefit of 
effective carbon management. This risk could be identified within the mentioned programs as a 
risk triggered by program activities.
•	 Contextual risks. Contextual risks are those risks resulting from the strategic and 
organizational environment of the program, including the stakeholders, variations in the 
strategy, or the evolution of the business environment or program’s business case. Some 
contextual risks may also be escalated from the program components when their impact and 
treatment exceed the boundary of accountability of the components’ managers.
Referring to the case study, risks related to stakeholder engagement can be identified as follows: 
The diverse stakeholder group is vital in managing project risks and driving the green portfolio 
toward its ultimate strategic objective. However, misalignment or conflicts of interest among 
stakeholders, such as environmental assessment advocates opposing certain aspects of the wind 
turbine project or local community members resisting public safety measures, can pose significant 
risks at the program level, affecting the realization of program benefits.
Some risks identified at the program level or escalated from the project level may need to be 
escalated to the enterprise or portfolio level. These risks impact the business and operational 
performance generated through the exploitation of the business capabilities created by the 
program. Escalated risks follow the same analysis processes as other risks identified at the 
program level.
6.2.2 Program Risk Qualitative and Quantitative Analyses
Evaluation of risks at the program level is performed by considering the depth of each risk’s impact 
on the realization of the expected benefits or the development of the expected organizational 
capability. The aim of these analyses is to evaluate whether or not the impact can be contained 
within the limits of the program budget, timelines, and other success criteria.

82
Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
When the impact affects the program’s ability to deliver its benefits or organizational capabilities, 
then the risk is addressed at the program level.
When the impact affects the ability of the organization to deliver the performance and value 
expected to be obtained from the benefits and capabilities created by the program, then the risk 
and its treatment are escalated to the enterprise or portfolio level. In addition, the risk and its 
treatment are escalated when the risk affects the expected financial and operational performance 
anticipated from the new capabilities beyond the agreed thresholds.
Case Study: Program Risk Analyses in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
The following are some examples of how qualitative and quantitative analyses could be used in 
the municipality case study. These examples note that risk treatment would require balancing cost, 
schedule, and the ability to deliver expected benefits and organizational capabilities. If impacts 
exceed the agreed thresholds, risks should be escalated to higher levels for more resources or 
strategic decision-making:
•	 Energy program—interdependency risk (qualitative and quantitative analysis). 
The risk that a delay in an interconnected project will impact the Compact Wind Turbine Project 
can be evaluated qualitatively by discussing with project managers and assessing the likelihood 
and impact based on previous similar projects. Quantitatively, we can model the potential time 
delay and calculate its cost implications. If the impact can be contained within the program 
budget and timelines, it is managed at the program level. But if this delay threatens the entire 
program’s ability to deliver its benefits (e.g., energy production falls below necessary levels for 
the municipality), the risk should be escalated to the portfolio or enterprise level.
•	 Public safety program—benefits realization risk (qualitative analysis). This risk can 
be assessed qualitatively by soliciting feedback from the public and law enforcement officials. 
If the public safety measures do not effectively reduce safety concerns or are not well received 
by the community, this could prevent the realization of program benefits. This risk could be 
addressed at the program level through community outreach or revisions to the measures. 
But if the risk affects the municipality’s overall ability to ensure public safety, it may need to be 
escalated to the portfolio level.
•	 Carbon data app project—integration risk (quantitative analysis). This risk can be 
assessed quantitatively by performing data accuracy checks and system integration tests. If 
the integration errors are minor and can be corrected within the project budget, this risk is 
addressed at the project level. However, if major errors could undermine the entire program’s 
ability to monitor and manage the municipality’s carbon footprint effectively, this risk would 
escalate to the program, portfolio, or enterprise level.
•	 Cross-program risk (qualitative and quantitative analysis). If the Compact Wind Turbine 
Project cannot meet the energy needs of the public safety program, this could affect both programs. 
The risk can be assessed qualitatively by discussions with the project teams, and quantitatively by 
analyzing the energy demands and generation capacities. The risk would be handled at the program 
level if the shortfall can be compensated within the budget (e.g., through energy-saving measures 
or purchasing additional power). If not, the risk would need to be escalated.

83
Risk Management in the Context of Program Management
•	 Risk related to stakeholder engagement (qualitative analysis). This risk can be assessed 
qualitatively by engaging stakeholders, understanding their concerns, and evaluating the 
potential impact on the project outcomes. If stakeholder disagreements can be managed within 
the program through negotiation or compromise, they can be handled at the program level. If 
the conflicts threaten the municipality’s sustainability and energy independence goals, the risk 
would be escalated to the portfolio or enterprise level.
6.2.3 Program Risk Response Strategies
In principle, all potential responses listed in Section 4 may be used when responding to risks at the 
program level.
Strategies developed to deal with risks at the program level consist of the activities agreed upon 
in the risk management plan and budgeted for in the program’s budget or contingency reserve. 
Some of the responses are also developed due to escalation from the component level. These risk 
responses consist of adding program activities or components, updating the program baselines, or 
removing components from the program.
These new components are intended to maximize the creation of further business benefits or 
enhance organizational capabilities development. Alternatively, the intent may be to maintain or 
reinforce the program’s contribution to achieve related strategic objectives or minimize threats to 
the organization’s objectives and strategy.
Case Study: Program Risk Response Strategies in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
The following strategies are designed to respond to the previously identified risks in the case 
study. The main aim of these strategies would be to either enhance the program’s ability to create 
or realize benefits and develop organizational capabilities, or to minimize threats to the program 
and the municipality’s strategic objectives. These strategies should be documented in the risk 
management plan and adequately budgeted for in the program’s budget or contingency reserve, 
and then addressed where applicable with schedule buffers and other contingency measures.
Some potential risk categories and response strategies at the program level:
•	 Energy program—interdependency risk. A contingency plan can be developed and 
budgeted to manage unexpected delays or issues in interconnected projects. This plan may 
include having backup suppliers or additional resources on standby. Also, additional project 
management oversight could be added to the program to ensure better coordination and early 
detection of potential delays or issues.
•	 Public safety program—benefit realization risk. The program could introduce new 
components like community outreach initiatives, training sessions, or public awareness 
campaigns to enhance public acceptance and efficacy of safety measures. These components 
would be designed to maximize the program’s benefits by ensuring the measures are used 
correctly and accepted by the community.

--- SOURCE: riskmanagementpracticeguide.pdf | PAGE 99 ---
84
Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
•	 Carbon data app project—integration risk. An additional component, like a dedicated 
data integration team or a third-party data auditing service, could be added to the program. This 
approach would aim to enhance the project’s capability to integrate data accurately, and thus, 
effectively manage the municipality’s carbon footprint.
•	 Cross-program risk. The energy program could add a new project or initiative focused on 
energy efficiency or backup power sources to ensure the energy demands of the public safety 
program are met. This approach could involve updating the program baselines to account for 
these new initiatives. The costs of such an initiative would need to be weighed against the 
expected costs of realization of this cross-program risk.
•	 Risk related to stakeholder engagement. A proactive stakeholder engagement plan 
could be developed and included in the program. This plan could feature regular meetings, 
transparent communication, and dispute-resolution processes. The intent would be to 
maintain the program’s alignment with the strategic objectives by minimizing potential 
stakeholder conflicts.
6.2.4 Implementing Program Risk Responses
Implementation of risk responses within a program consists of:
•	 Triggering the risk responses as they have been defined in the risk management plan,
•	 Transferring the corresponding budget from the reserves into the budget at completion,
•	 Dropping one high-risk project to protect the whole program’s benefits, and
•	 Updating the program baselines accordingly.
When new components are added, they become part of the regular program scope and are subject 
to the application of the standard program delivery and deployment processes.
Implementation of risk responses at the component level is aligned and performed in coordination 
with the responses that are implemented at the program level. Any formally approved risk response 
is integral to the program management plan. Implementing an approved risk response is not 
a change to the program initiated through a formal, integrated program change management 
procedure. However, any new responses planned to address emergent risks that could affect 
program baselines would become part of the integrated program change management procedure.
6.2.5 Monitoring Program Risks
Monitoring risks at the program level is both a tactical and strategic activity:
•	 Tactical activity. Tactical activities oversee the aspects related to the execution of the 
anticipatory and responsive actions undertaken to respond to identified risks and the ongoing 
identification, analysis, and response to new risks.
•	 Strategic activity. Strategic activities address the evolution of the risk characteristics of 
each program component individually, the overall program’s risk profile, and the impact of that 
evolution on the business benefits or organizational capabilities it is intended to generate.

85
Risk Management in the Context of Program Management
Case Study: Monitoring Program Risks in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
In the Compact Wind Turbine Project, monitoring program risks as a tactical activity within the 
energy program includes assessing the effectiveness of contingency plans for unexpected project 
delays (e.g., backup suppliers, additional resources), which could be monitored by tracking project 
timelines, costs, and deliverables’ quality. For the public safety program, the effectiveness of 
community outreach initiatives could be monitored by tracking public sentiment, crime rates, and 
usage rates of safety measures.
Monitoring program risks as a strategic activity in the Compact Wind Turbine Project could include 
regular risk assessments that can be conducted for each component of both the energy program and 
public safety program, looking at changes in risk factors like material availability, weather conditions, 
community acceptance, regulatory changes, etc. The carbon data app project’s risk profile can be 
analyzed in terms of data accuracy, integration success, and user adoption rates. Monitoring how 
these risk profiles evolve helps identify new risks or inefficiencies in the response strategies, which 
may affect the realization of expected benefits or the development of organizational capabilities.
These risk profiles are regularly analyzed in order to identify any potential trends that indicate new 
risks or the inefficiency or ineffectiveness of the response strategies.
The monitoring of risk responses is conducted according to their quantitative and qualitative 
parameters, as defined in the management plans, considering the overall impact from the 
component to the enterprise level. For example, in the case of stakeholder engagement risk, the 
effectiveness of the stakeholder engagement plan could be assessed qualitatively by the quality 
of stakeholder interactions and conflict resolution outcomes. Stakeholder feedback, meeting 
attendance, or resolution time could be tracked quantitatively.
These risk responses are intended to effectively treat the respective specific risks and contribute 
to enhancing or maintaining the realization of expected benefits. It is important to perform a 
qualitative assessment to ensure that the risk responses are efficient and effective.
Monitoring risks at the program level also includes ensuring that risk-related elements of the governance 
framework are properly implemented by the program’s component managers and that they are effective.
6.3 Integration of Risk Management into the  
Program Management Performance Domains
Several risk management practices can be applied across the program life cycle within all of the 
performance domains to achieve their objectives (see Figure 6-3). These practices typically cover the 
areas shown in Table 6-1.
6.3.1 Strategic Alignment
Strategic Alignment ensures that a program contributes to organizational strategy in the expected 
way. Risk management efforts at the program level address new strategic opportunities and threats. 
When necessary, these efforts lead to appropriate program redefinition or changes in the relevant 
program components.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
6.3.2 Benefits Management
Benefits Management ensures that the program benefits described in the business case and other 
program governance documents are successfully realized. The main focus of risk management 
in this area is to (a) identify opportunities that could increase these benefits, (b) take advantage 
of opportunities more efficiently and effectively, and (c) manage threats that could potentially 
jeopardize the program’s efforts to realize its benefits.
6.3.3 Stakeholder Engagement
From the program perspective, key stakeholders typically include program governance board 
members, the program manager, managers of program components, partners, key suppliers, 
and regulators impacting or being impacted by the program benefits. From this perspective, 
program risk management focuses on opportunities for increasing effectiveness in realizing 
program benefits and on minimizing threats that could lower the ability to do so. It is realized by 
effective engagement of stakeholders at the program level and ensures consistency of stakeholder 
engagement strategies among program components.

Risk Management in the Context of Program Management
6.3.4 Governance Framework
The Governance Framework performance domain uses the framework, functions, and processes by 
which a program is monitored, managed, and supported in order to meet organizational strategic 
and operational goals. The governance framework also addresses program complexity in an effort 
to reduce it. These activities are backed by risk management practices and focused on analyzing 
various governance approaches from the risk perspective. In addition, the selection of individuals to 
perform key governance roles is supported by risk analysis.
From the risk management perspective, a key element of the governance framework is the risk 
escalation process, which is integrated with processes within components and backed by program 
governance processes and structures.
6.3.5 Collaboration
Collaboration is interwoven throughout all aspects of program management. Risk management is 
an inherent part of the Collaboration performance domain supporting the optimization of programs 
for benefits delivery.

6.3.6 Life Cycle Management
The Life Cycle Management performance domain ensures that program definition, delivery, and 
closure activities are effectively managed. This is accomplished to ensure program benefits are 
realized using the right set of components, in the right sequence, and with adherence to the 
program’s business case and other governance documents.
Risk management in this area focuses on identifying and addressing program-level risks as early 
as possible. This is achieved by fully integrating risk identification, analysis, and response planning 
throughout all program and component activities.
Case Study: Program Management Performance Domains in the 
Compact Wind Turbine Project
Strategic Alignment in the Compact Wind Turbine Project
Strategic Alignment in the municipality’s green portfolio context ensures that the programs 
contribute to the organization’s strategy as intended as follows:
•	 Strategic opportunities. New developments, such as advancements in renewable energy 
technology or rising public interest in carbon tracking, could present opportunities to enhance 
the programs’ contributions to the strategic objectives.
•	 Strategic threats. Potential threats, like changing regulations or rising crime rates, could 
jeopardize the programs’ alignment with the strategic objectives.
•	 Risk responses. Risk management identifies and responds to these opportunities and 
threats, possibly leading to program changes. For example, the energy program may adopt new 
technology, the public safety program may introduce new safety measures, and the carbon data 
app project may enhance its data security. Maintaining this alignment as the strategic landscape 
evolves ensures that the programs continue to support the strategic objectives of sustainability 
and carbon neutrality.
Benefits Management in the Compact Wind Turbine Project
In the case study, Benefits Management ensures that the benefits of each program in the 
municipality’s green portfolio are realized as follows:
•	 Energy program. Opportunities may include exploring new renewable technologies or 
securing grants to increase benefits. Efficient delivery could involve optimizing timelines or 
supplier reliability. Threats may result from design inconsistencies or regulatory changes.
•	 Public safety program. Opportunities could be partnerships with community organizations 
or new technologies. Efficiency may be improved by training local personnel or using data 
analytics. Threats could be public resistance or unexpected crime rate increases.
•	 Carbon data app project. Opportunities could include integration with other systems or 
public access. Efficiency may be improved through agile development or automated testing. 
Threats may include technological failures or data breaches.

For example, by engaging stakeholders effectively, the municipality can maximize the realization of 
program benefits and minimize threats. For instance, consistent engagement with developers, data 
providers, and users could uncover opportunities to improve the carbon data app’s functionality 
and user experience, thus increasing its benefits. Furthermore, coordination with cybersecurity 
experts could help mitigate potential threats of data breaches.
Governance Framework in the Compact Wind Turbine Project
For the municipality’s green portfolio, the Governance Framework performance domain 
considerations may involve the following:
•	 Governance framework. This element involves establishing a governance framework for each 
program, such as the energy program, public safety program, and carbon data app project. The 
framework defines roles, responsibilities, decision-making processes, reporting structures, and risk 
escalation pathways, providing a structured approach to managing program-level complexities.
•	 Risk management integration. This element involves incorporating risk management 
practices into governance approaches. For instance, the governance board may regularly review 
risk analyses to understand potential threats and opportunities. This would inform decision-
making processes, helping to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities, which may involve 
adjusting project timelines, reallocating resources, or changing strategic approaches.
•	 Key governance roles. This element involves leveraging risk analysis to select individuals for key 
governance roles. For example, an individual with extensive experience in managing regulatory 
compliance may be chosen to oversee the Compact Wind Turbine Project due to its regulatory risks.
•	 Risk escalation process. Implementing a risk escalation process allows for the seamless 
transfer of risk management from the component to the program level. If a risk cannot be 
effectively managed within a project, such as a significant cost overrun in the Compact Wind 
Turbine Project, it would be escalated to the program governance board.
Collaboration in the Compact Wind Turbine Project
In the case study, Collaboration is interwoven throughout all aspects of the municipality’s program 
management, taking value delivery planning, program alignment, and program complexity into 
consideration. Risk management, as an inherent part of the Collaboration performance domain, 
supports the optimization of the municipality’s programs to help ensure the delivery of benefits overall.
Life Cycle Management in the Compact Wind Turbine Project
Life Cycle Management in the municipality’s green portfolio ensures that each program, from the 
energy program to the public safety program, is effectively managed from definition to delivery 
and closure. Risks such as cost overruns, regulatory challenges, public resistance, or technological 
failures are identified, analyzed, and addressed proactively throughout the program life cycle. This 
approach, integrated into every stage of the program, ensures the timely realization of program 
benefits in line with the business case and governance documents while mitigating potential risks.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
Case Study: Program Activities in the Compact Wind Turbine Project
In the municipality’s green portfolio, program activities are designed to ensure smooth program 
execution. For instance, if a risk arises, like a significant cost overrun in one project, it would be 
escalated to the program level. This integration ensures no gaps exist in risk management coverage 
among the program and its components.
6.3.7 Program Activities
Even though the management of program-level activities often differs significantly from the 
component level, risk management processes for the supporting program activities are similar in 
nature to the component projects.
The governance framework establishes policies on risk management among the program and its 
components, including escalation mechanisms. These policies help ensure that there are no gaps 
among the component and program levels that are not covered by risk management practices.

Risk Management in the Context of Project Management
7
Risk Management in the  
Context of Project Management
The purpose of risk management at the project level is to support the optimal delivery of project 
results, leading to the realization of the benefits for which the project was undertaken. In addition, 
risk management helps to ensure this occurs within the identified project constraints.
Projects aim to create a unique product, service, or result, with their success gauged by the 
ability to meet defined objectives and deliver value. Uncertainties from operational activities 
and enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) introduce risks. These risks, evaluated based on their 
potential impact on achieving project objectives and value, are primarily assessed at the tactical 
level. While the broader considerations related to expected value or benefits are often elevated 
to the portfolio or program governance level, it is vital to understand that expected value analysis 
also takes place at the project level. Ensuring that project teams are aligned with the strategic 
objectives that initiated the project’s authorization is paramount, as this empowers them to 
proactively manage both opportunities and threats. It is worth noting that a project’s authorization 
is not solely for risk management; it is for the entirety of project activities, with risk management 
being a pivotal component.
7.1 Risk Management Gaps among  
the Project and Higher Levels
As described in previous sections, risk management is critical to an organization’s success, 
particularly when managing risks across different levels of portfolios, programs, projects, and 
organizational structures. However, specific factors should be considered and communicated to the 
appropriate stakeholders when addressing risks at the project level.
Since not all organizations have formal risk management structures, it can be challenging to find 
support for projects. In such cases, integrating risk management into project processes becomes 
crucial, along with fostering cross-functional communication about potential risks and seeking 
advice from internal experts or external consultants. Educating employees on risk management 
principles and continuously learning from past projects to refine practices are also essential 
strategies for effectively managing risks in organizations without formal structures such as a project 
management office or enterprise risk management.
7.1.1 Establishing Risk Thresholds
Risk thresholds should be defined in order to evaluate if a risk can be managed at the project 
level or should be escalated to higher levels for further action. A project team should engage with 
stakeholders to understand their risk appetites and risk thresholds. A qualitative method should 
be used to define risk thresholds and can be guided by the expected monetary value (EMV) or the 
probability and impact defined in the project risk matrix. The risks that are within the risk appetite 
can be managed by the project manager at the project level. However, the risks outside of the risk 
appetite should be escalated to higher levels. Thresholds should be captured in the project’s risk 
management plan and are typically stated and communicated to the project team and reflected 
in the definition of risk impact levels for the project. Various risk response strategies can be 
implemented in either of the mentioned scenarios. It is crucial to reinforce consistency through 
structured risk management governance.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
The risk threshold, which represents the level of risk a project can tolerate, is a crucial factor in 
deciding whether to escalate a risk to higher decision levels. Ignoring the risk threshold can lead to 
inefficient resource allocation and may cause practitioners to overlook risks that genuinely require 
higher-level attention.
7.1.2 Addressing Risks from Higher and Strategic Levels
Organizational and high-level portfolio and program risks can significantly impact the risks of 
the project. Enterprise environmental factors, such as strategic decisions, enterprise resource 
management, market positioning, competitive advantages in the market, and strategic 
objectives, can affect the viability of a project. As described in Section 4, a decision to implement 
a project can be a response to reduce the portfolio risks or exploit the opportunities within the 
organization. These goals and objectives are achieved, in part, by aligning responsibility and 
accountability for risk management with the organizational business model.
7.1.3 Project-Level Risk Interfaces with Operations
In the broader context, projects interact with various operational aspects within the organization. To 
ensure smooth operations, it is crucial to effectively manage the potential risks that may affect both 
the project and its interfaces with operations.
It is equally important to capitalize on project-level opportunities that can foster improved 
coordination with operations. This involves optimizing resource allocation, cutting costs, enhancing 
efficiency, and bolstering reliability at the higher management levels. Organizations should 
establish a shared understanding of risk and be well prepared to address both anticipated threats 
and opportunities.
Additionally, it is critical to identify the various organizational levels that the project may interact 
with, which include not only executive management, but also operations management, portfolio 
management, program components, and project teams. It is worth noting that there are different 
organizational structures, not just projectized structures. In matrix or functional organizations, for 
example, projects are intertwined with the wider organizational framework, rather than operating 
as isolated entities.
7.2 Project Risk Management Life Cycle
The life cycle of risk management, as described in Section 4, generally applies to project 
management. However, there are several additional considerations for the corresponding processes 
that should be taken into account in this context.
Various techniques can be used for project risk management life cycle processes, which are listed 
throughout this section.
7.2.1 Enhancing Risk Analysis and Involving the Right Participants
When it comes to conducting a comprehensive risk analysis, it is essential to assemble the 
appropriate individuals. The project charter and initial planning teams can serve as a foundation for 
more extensive and iterative risk analysis sessions.

93
Risk Management in the Context of Project Management
Once the project is underway and in the execution phase, these team members, serving as subject 
matter experts, contribute critical perspectives that are indispensable for an in-depth risk analysis. 
They offer insights that may not be readily available to the project manager.
Hence, the inclusion of team members in the risk analysis process is of paramount importance. 
The time allocated to risk assessment and analysis sessions may vary depending on the project 
management approach (adaptive, predictive, or hybrid), as well as other factors such as the project’s 
size and complexity.
Case Study: Project Management in the Context of the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
In reference to the case study that is used throughout this practice guide, the involvement of cross-
functional teams is imperative to ensuring effective risk analysis. These teams should encompass 
a range of knowledge, skills, and expertise, including technical proficiency, domain or business 
acumen, financial prowess, and regulatory compliance competence. This collaborative composition 
is important to the comprehensive assessment of risks.
Engaging local community members, recognized as other key stakeholders, is also crucial. Their 
perspectives on social and environmental impacts, as well as their concerns, should be incorporated 
into risk assessments. For example, they may articulate concerns related to noise pollution or the 
aesthetic implications of wind turbines.
In addition, media representatives should be actively engaged to transparently communicate risk 
management efforts to the public. Effective media interaction can significantly influence public 
perceptions and expectations regarding the project’s inherent risks.
Conducting regular stakeholder meetings is fundamental. These meetings facilitate open discussions 
on project progress and risks, cultivating a sense of shared responsibility and collaboration among 
stakeholders, thus ensuring their active participation in risk management efforts.
Moreover, agricultural landowners, particularly those hosting turbines, should be included in 
risk discussions regarding land use agreements, potential impacts on farming activities, and 
compensation arrangements in the event of adverse effects.
In certain scenarios, the involvement of external experts or consultants, possessing specialized 
knowledge in wind turbine technology, environmental impact assessments, or regulatory 
compliance, can be advantageous. These experts offer objective insights into potential risks, further 
fortifying the project’s risk assessment process.
7.2.2 Project Risk Identification
Identification of risks at the project level is based on operational and contextual inputs. Operational 
inputs come from the activities of the project itself. Among these inputs are:
•	 Project scope statement. There are several risks related to the specifications and agreed-
upon methods of delivery for products, services, or other results that are expected to be 
delivered by the project.

94
Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
•	 Project management approach. Regardless of the approach selected, the approach itself 
introduces some risks to the project. The adaptive, predictive, and hybrid project approaches 
have different levels of risks and uncertainty, as described in Section 4.
•	 Work breakdown structure (WBS), activity list, or backlog. There are some risks 
directly connected to the decomposition of the project work and triggered by its execution.
•	 Estimates. Estimates are performed in terms of time, cost, effort, resources, and velocity. The 
target accuracy of an estimate is the level of risk tolerated.
•	 Dependencies and sequence of work. Interdependencies and the resulting sequence 
of work are sources of risk. In predictive approaches, special attention should be paid to the 
critical path and external dependencies created by the sharing of resources with other projects. 
If the critical path changes during the project life cycle, the criticality of the risks related to the 
elements on that critical path may also be dynamic. Alternatively, in adaptive approaches, in the 
backlog, the use of feedback, interdependencies of epics, and user stories should be carefully 
considered.
•	 Procurement plans. Subcontracting parts of the project scope may involve risk transfer, 
which may also trigger new risks or secondary risks.
•	 Change requests. Each time a change is implemented within a project, it may eliminate 
certain risks but may also trigger new ones. The potential risks (threats or opportunities) 
resulting from implementing the change request should be identified and managed throughout 
the project life cycle, whether applying an adaptive, predictive, or hybrid project management 
approach.
•	 Historical data. Based on experience, it is important to identify systemic risks and expedite 
their treatment. Systemic risks are identified at the portfolio level and should be managed across 
all of the projects within the portfolio.
Contextual risks result from the consideration of enterprise environmental factors (EEFs), 
organizational process assets (OPAs), and other strategic or organizational aspects shaping the 
environment of the project such as:
•	 Organizational process assets (OPAs). Standard operating procedures, templates, or 
organizational policies may be too stringent and rigid, or they may require extended approval 
chains that can result in project delays or cost escalations. Also, the negotiation process may not 
allow for any accommodations from the contractors, resulting in constrained relationships.
•	 Stakeholder analysis. Key stakeholders can bring several opportunities to be exploited; 
however, when handled inadequately, they may introduce threats that should be addressed.
•	 Business case. The business case often implies a factor of profitability or positive return 
on investment that is exposed to a certain level of uncertainty or risk. The ability to achieve 
and sustain benefits after project completion is part of risk identification. Risks impacting the 
realization of benefits can be addressed during project execution.
•	 Program- or portfolio-governance-level success factors. These factors may vary over 
time and change the priority level of the project within the program or portfolio.
•	 Enterprise environmental factors (EEFs). Factors such as the strategy of the organization, 
its structure, the dynamics of its business environment, or the variability of its regulatory 
environment can be triggers of risks that directly impact the project.

Risk Management in the Context of Project Management
Case Study: Project Risk Identification in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
Operational Input Risks in the Compact Wind Turbine Project
•	 Project scope statement. In the municipality, preferential engineering is a risk to the 
Compact Wind Turbine Project. This risk involves additional considerations and features to the 
project scope to satisfy all of the stakeholders, rather than the agreed-upon project scope. The 
potential consequences may be cost overruns and delays to the project.
•	 Project management approach. The Compact Wind Turbine Project is being implemented 
using a predictive life cycle. However, the carbon data app is being managed iteratively using a 
hybrid life cycle. The risk management structure, reviews, flexibility, adaptivity, transparency, and 
communication are varied within the green portfolio, raising the potential for risks related to the 
project management approach.
•	 Work breakdown structure (WBS), activity list, or backlog. There are also key 
considerations when creating the WBS and activity list from the business case development 
used for the delivery schedule of the Compact Wind Turbine Project, such as hierarchy 
levels, integration of subsystems, standardization, sequence of activities, or duration 
estimation.
•	 Estimates. The municipality used specific software for the estimation of the cost of the projects 
based on their nature. For the Compact Wind Turbine Project, the target accuracy was achieved 
by incorporating the complexity and qualitative risk ratings with specific values based on the 
industry standards.
•	 Dependencies and sequence of work. Referring to the green portfolio, the 
interdependencies within the public safety program and the carbon data app project have a 
potential impact on the timeframe and cost of the Compact Wind Turbine Project. For instance, 
at a point in time during the delivery phase, additional resources may be required to compress 
the wind turbine schedule to fulfill the interdependencies with other projects. As a result, the 
schedule risk may increase and additional costs may be incurred.
•	 Procurement plans. Supply chain disruptions may be another risk for the Compact Wind 
Turbine Project. Potential consequences of this risk could be project delays, cost overruns, and 
reputational impacts to the municipality.
•	 Change requests. A recent change request was approved by the municipality to mitigate 
the delays to the project schedule as a result of procurement complexities. Though this change 
mitigates one risk, it introduces new risks related to the availability of resources and increased 
project costs.
•	 Historical data. A lack of qualified design resources in the energy market poses a risk to 
the Compact Wind Turbine Project. The municipality has raised it as a systemic risk to higher 
management levels and the boards of directors from past projects. Potential proactive measures 
may include utilizing a design and construction (D&C) contract type or early engagement of the 
planning partners.

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
Contextual Input Risks in the Compact Wind Turbine Project
•	 Organizational process assets (OPAs). Due to the complexity and public-facing nature 
of the Compact Wind Turbine Project, there are many procedures, templates, and policies that 
should be followed by the municipality, some of which require lengthy approval processes. 
These processes can delay the project schedule or cause cost escalations.
•	 Stakeholder analysis. Several stakeholders, who are either internal or external, have been 
identified for the Compact Wind Turbine Project. For example, a failure to engage with customers 
and the community is a reputational risk to the municipality, which should be addressed early in 
the planning phase.
•	 Business case. A key risk in the context of the Compact Wind Turbine Project is the failure to 
consider the constructability of the wind turbine in the business case development and option 
engineering. This risk could impact the construction and benefits realization later in the delivery.
•	 Program- or portfolio-governance-level success factors. The Compact Wind Turbine 
Project may not have been funded due to escalations in the market. So, the municipality could 
have decided to define another project within the green portfolio or to hold this project for a 
certain period.
•	 Enterprise environmental factors (EEFs). Environmental regulations may impact the 
necessity of implementing the Compact Wind Turbine Project or may increase its compliance risk.
7.2.3 Project Risk Qualitative and Quantitative Analyses
The evaluation of risks at the project level is performed by taking into account the degree of 
impact on the project objectives and the probability of occurrence. The purpose of these analyses 
is to evaluate whether or not the impact can be contained within the limits of the project budget 
and the boundary of accountability of the project manager. Risks that have an impact evaluated 
as containable within the limits of accountability of the project manager and team are dealt with 
in the project risk management plan and strategy. Every risk impact that exceeds the limits of 
accountability is escalated to the appropriate governance level.
If the risk impacts the ability of the organization to obtain or sustain the expected benefits, then the 
risk and its treatment are escalated to the appropriate governance level.
Case Study: Project Risk Analyses in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
In the case study, the Compact Wind Turbine Project core team identified the risk associated with 
interdependencies between the public safety program and the carbon data app project as high 
risk, exceeding the project’s risk threshold. The wind turbine’s project manager, with restricted 
accountability for the project, took the initiative to escalate this risk to the portfolio manager. In 
response, the portfolio manager decided to address this risk by proactively coordinating among the 
interdependent projects, thus mitigating the potential negative impacts.

Risk Management in the Context of Project Management
7.2.4 Project Risk Response Strategies
In principle, all of the potential responses listed in Section 4 can be used when responding to risks at 
the project level.
The strategies developed to deal with risks at the project level consist of activities that are guided 
by the risk management plan, budgeted for accordingly, and funded by the project’s contingency 
reserve. Risk responses consist of additional activities or work packages to update the project’s 
baselines or remove activities from these same baselines.
Whenever the project is part of a program or managed as part of a portfolio, escalation of risks 
to a higher governance level is always one of the available responses. Escalation can increase the 
effectiveness or efficiency of dealing with specific risks impacting the program or portfolio, or with 
risks requiring funding above the project’s contingency reserves.
Seeking decisions from upper management levels (program or portfolio) regarding go/no-go 
determinations for specific project scope elements or the project as a whole is essential. The 
heightened risks that transcend individual project authority often necessitate interactions 
that may recommend project cancellation or the trimming of chartered scope elements and 
project objectives.
Case Study: Project Risk Response Strategies in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
In the case study, when a risk materializes and gets escalated to the higher level, the program or 
portfolio manager will have the authority to transfer the contingencies to the project budget. 
Then, the project manager should update the project scope and time baselines to reflect the risk 
response impacts.
7.2.5 Implementing Project Risk Responses
The implementation of risk responses within a project is performed according to the risk 
management plan, uses the corresponding budget from the reserves into the budget, and updates 
the project baselines accordingly. Together, these activities become part of the regular project scope 
and are subject to the application of project execution processes.
Case Study: Implementing Project Risk Responses in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
For instance, in the case study, a community and stakeholder engagement plan is developed to 
identify and manage the expectations of the local community of the Compact Wind Turbine Project. 
Also, a community review group is formed to engage the community during the project life cycle.

98
Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
In some scenarios, the implementation of a risk response plan is not initiated through a formal 
project change management procedure. Risk response is part of the project management plan 
and does not require a formal change control process because it has already been approved as 
part of the risk management plan. Alternatively, some organizations strictly follow a formal process 
for any change, specifically where there is dependency with a customer and joint development 
is happening.
7.2.6 Monitoring Project Risk
Monitoring risks at the project level consists of:
•	 Checking the status of the risks that have already been identified,
•	 Verifying whether any known risk has not occurred or is not about to occur,
•	 Monitoring the status of all actions implemented to respond to the detection or occurrence of 
a risk,
•	 Monitoring the remaining contingency reserve and management reserve,
•	 Observing the risk trends and profile,
•	 Assessing the project’s key performance indicators and key risk indicators, and
•	 Ensuring effective communication among the team members and stakeholders, particularly the 
risk owners and risk response owners.
Capturing newly identified risks is imperative, as it helps ensure effective monitoring of project 
risks. This process involves promptly identifying emergent risks to address them effectively. These 
activities typically lead to updates of plans, registers, and controlling documents. In addition, 
performance reports are regularly analyzed to identify any potential trends that could indicate new 
risks or the ineffectiveness of response strategies.
The risk responses implemented to anticipate and prevent the occurrence of threats or exploit and 
enhance opportunities are conducted according to their quantitative parameters of time, cost, 
scope, and specifications. A qualitative assessment evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of risk 
treatment for specific risks that have occurred.
Case Study: Monitoring Project Risk in the  
Compact Wind Turbine Project
Referring to the Compact Wind Turbine Project, the project manager and project team conduct 
regular risk revisits. The status of inherent and secondary risks, risk ratings, treatment actions, and 
their efficiency and effectiveness are monitored. Project management plans, documents, and 
registers are updated. Reports are generated and distributed to internal stakeholders within the 
municipality. Systemic risks are also reported to the portfolio level and senior management for high-
level analysis and actions.

Risk Management in the Context of Project Management
7.3 Integration of Risk Management  
into Project Management Processes
The subsequent sections offer detailed insights into integrating risk processes across the project 
life cycle. Process Groups: A Practice Guide [7] outlines the Project Management Process Groups and 
risk management processes. While Process Groups are conventionally associated with predictive 
approaches, this practice guide ensures inclusivity by addressing adaptive and hybrid approaches.
7.3.1 Initiating Processes
Initiating processes are performed to define a new project or a new phase of an existing project 
by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase. An essential part of that work is related 
to understanding the high-level risks that may impact the realization of objectives specified in the 
business case. It is essential to address these risks before authorizing the project or phase.
Another important consideration is the selection of the project management life cycle early in the 
project initiation. As summarized in Section 4, adaptive, predictive, and hybrid project management 
life cycles are varied based on flexibility, transparency, frequent delivery, and feedback in risk 
management. Utilizing each one of them has an impact on all areas of project management 
risk identification. The structure of the risk management, communications, risk monitoring, and 
feedback can exploit opportunities or introduce new threats to the project.
Another important aspect is understanding the risks related to the key stakeholders, their interests, 
and potential conflicts during the project initiations. Unresolved stakeholder conflicts can have 
negative implications for both the realization of project benefits and the acceptance of project 
deliverables, thereby impacting the overall success and effectiveness of the project.
In addition, implementing a “premortem” during project initiation can help identify future events 
that may hinder project objectives and uncover factors that can enhance success. Anticipating 
failure scenarios and assessing resource utilization allows for early risk identification and 
brainstorming response strategies, thereby increasing project success chances.
7.3.2 Planning Processes
Planning processes establish the scope of the project, refine the objectives, and define the course of 
action required to attain the objectives that the project was undertaken to achieve.
The selection of the overall risk management approach is one of the key planning decisions. This 
decision involves the analysis of risks that could potentially impact the effectiveness of the risk 
management processes.
The key areas of planning that also include risk management practices are:
•	 Integrity of the planning processes and the resulting plans, and
•	 Selection of the management approaches in all areas relevant to the project as well as estimation 
activities.
Typically, initiating processes lead to the identification of a high number of risks because they include 
analytical work necessary for planning. During this planning phase, more information is revealed

Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide
about the agreed-upon timeframes, contingencies, methods of delivery, constructability, and 
procurements. It is important to ensure that risk identification becomes a natural part of every process.
7.3.3 Executing Processes
Executing processes are performed to complete the work defined in the project management plan 
to satisfy requirements and achieve objectives. Successful risk management depends on the flow of 
knowledge within the project and the organizations involved in its execution.
Risk management practices are most effective when supported by a culture that embraces 
proactive behavior, open communication, organizational learning, continuous improvement, 
innovation, and the use of tools such as big data and artificial intelligence. Integration of 
risk management practices with team building and management, transparency, quality 
management, habits of testing and learning, execution of stakeholder engagement strategies, and 
communication processes is essential.
7.3.4 Monitoring and Controlling Processes
Monitoring and Controlling processes review and regulate the progress and performance of the 
project, identify the required preventive and corrective actions, and initiate the corresponding 
changes to bring the project back on track.
Risk management ensures the integrity and reliability of reporting on the project performance and 
is based on the key performance indicators (KPIs). Risk management life cycle processes utilize the 
performance data and information as key inputs to identify, analyze, plan responses, and monitor 
the risks of the project.
7.3.5 Closing Processes
Closing processes are performed to formally complete or close the project or phase. Risk 
management activities during project closure include documenting lessons learned to be 
shared with future projects and other functions within the organization. The useful information 
documented may include the risk breakdown structure, controls and treatment actions for specific 
project types, effectiveness of specific risk responses, and systemic risks and issues requiring 
escalation to higher management levels.
The remaining risks that could impact benefits realization are documented in separate risk registers 
and handed over to the operations team before project closure.

Management Processes in the Compact Wind Turbine Project
Initiating Processes
In the Compact Wind Turbine Project case study, the key stakeholder groups include the 
municipality, the energy management department, local community members, environmental 
sustainability advocates, media representatives, the project manager, material suppliers, 
subcontracting agencies, and agricultural landowners.

101
Risk Management in the Context of Project Management
The project manager performs stakeholder analysis to understand their interests and impacts 
on the project objectives early in the initiation phase. They identify a conflict of interest between 
the property group and the agricultural landowners. The property group tends to negotiate the 
land easement based on experience and as per the allowed contingencies in the project budget. 
However, the inquiries from agricultural landowners reveal that they requested much higher 
amounts. Furthermore, when writing the business case, the project manager includes the risk in the 
project risk register with a set of high-level controls.
Planning Processes
In the planning phase, the project manager attempts to include a more realistic and accurate 
cost estimation for the land easements in order to prevent future corrective actions to the 
project budget or project scope. Based on the fact that more information is provided during the 
option engineering and concept design, the project manager consults the property group for 
more accurate prices of the agricultural lands in the area. As a result, more robust and accurate 
estimations can be included in the project contingencies.
Executing Processes
The project manager of the Compact Wind Turbine Project oversees the management of risks in the 
execution phase. Regular visits to the project risk registers, executing the risk response strategies and 
controls, and implementing the agreed-upon risk treatments should any risks materialize are among 
the actions in this phase. The contingencies are released into the project budget for implementing the 
risk treatments. Furthermore, residual risks are assessed and planned during project execution.
For example, a risk of noncompliance with environmental regulations materializes as the result of 
delays to the wind turbine project schedule. There are some recent changes to the environmental 
standards and the compliance requirements have been updated for this type of project. The project 
team identifies purchasing a temporary license as the treatment action. The project manager revisits 
the risk after the treatment to ensure the risk of noncompliance is under control.
Monitoring and Controlling Processes
The project manager monitors the project performance based on the data and information 
collected regularly. The project manager monitors the effectiveness and efficiency of the risk 
responses, overall project risk profile, and treatment actions. The project team looks for trends in 
the overall project performance and communicates them to the internal and external stakeholders. 
Potential preventive/corrective actions can be undertaken by raising change requests to bring the 
project back on track and improve project progress.
Closing Processes
In the closing phase, the risk management lessons learned are documented to feed into the 
municipality’s project management office (P MO) documents for future use. These documents 
include details of what went right and what went wrong when managing the Compact Wind 
Turbine Project. The effectiveness and efficiency of the risk responses and the residual risk ratings 
during the periodic reviews are shared with the wider stakeholders in the municipality. The feedback 
and level of stakeholder engagement in risk management efforts and trends are shared. In addition, 
a review of the overall project’s risk management approach is conducted to identify improvements.

7.4 Project Risk Management Controls
The purpose of risk management within projects is to secure the optimal delivery of the unique 
product, service, or result for which the project was undertaken. Risk management controls help to 
achieve optimal delivery by seamlessly integrating risk practices into the project management life 
cycle. This approach ensures that risk management becomes a natural part of project management.
The selection, tailoring, implementation, and monitoring of particular controls in a given project 
are a part of the governance activities. In all cases where the term risk is used, both residual and 
secondary risks should be considered when appropriate.

Appendix X2 
Techniques for the  
Risk Management Framework
Many techniques are in widespread use to support risk management processes. This appendix 
provides examples and highlights some of the most common and effective techniques that support 
the risk management life cycle. This information is not intended to explain the techniques in detail, 
but to list their most important characteristics. Those who are interested in learning more are 
encouraged to seek additional sources of information. Further guidance on the application of risk 
management in portfolios, programs, and projects can be found at PMIstandards+®, a dynamic 
platform that is a companion to PMI content. Use the QR code below to find more related subject 
matter. PMI membership or a subscription is required.
There are three major types of techniques: templates and lists, process techniques, and quantitative 
techniques. Templates and lists are designed to reflect industry and internal benchmarks and best 
practices as well as lessons learned. Process techniques make it easier to manage the risk management 
process and range from basic documents and spreadsheets to automated processes. Quantitative 
techniques support the analytical aspect of considering options and consequences in definitive terms.
The following sections describe some of the more popular techniques for each stage of the risk 
management framework. This list is not exhaustive, and several techniques are useful for more than 
one stage. Section X2.8 maps techniques to risk management stages where they may be useful. 
Some techniques are useful for more than one stage.
X2.1 Risk Management Planning
Plan Risk Management defines the approach to be followed for managing risks throughout the 
life cycle of the corresponding portfolio, program, or project. Planning sessions are recommended 
in order to build a common understanding of the risk approach among stakeholders and to gain 
agreement on the techniques to be used for managing risk. The risk management planning phase 
is usually supported by templates. The results of risk management planning are documented in the 
risk management plan. An overview of the key areas of focus is provided in Figure X2-1.

Depending upon the size and complexity of the work, some or all of the following elements are 
present in a risk management plan:
•	 Introduction;
•	 Portfolio, program, or project description;
•	 Risk management methodology;
•	 Risk management organization;
•	 Roles, responsibilities, and authority;
•	 Stakeholder risk appetite;
•	 Criteria for success;
•	 Risk management techniques and guidelines for use;
•	 Thresholds and corresponding definitions;
•	 Templates;
•	 Methods for communicating risks to stakeholders;
•	 Strategy; and
•	 Risk breakdown structure.
There are several software tools available to assist with risk management planning. While not 
discussed here, many of the techniques listed in the following sections are incorporated in risk 
management software.
X2.2 Identify Risks
Risk identification is carried out in order to develop a comprehensive list of all known uncertainties 
that could have an effect on the portfolio, program, or project. All risk identification techniques have 
strengths and weaknesses. Best practices suggest using more than one technique to identify risks to 
compensate for any one technique’s shortcomings and to increase risk identification rates. The main 
assumption in identifying risks is that biases and an array of human behavior patterns stand in the way 
of identifying unknown risks, identifying the wrong risks, or emphasizing or prioritizing the wrong 
risks. Some risk identification techniques are more helpful in identifying threats than opportunities or 
vice versa. It is important to balance the techniques used to target both threats and opportunities.

Appendix X2
Figure X2-2. The Relationship among Cause, Risk, and Effect

(fact or condition)
Effect

Risk
(uncertainty)
Whichever risk identification techniques are used, it is important that identified risks are 
unambiguously described in order to ensure that the risk process is focused on the actual risks and 
not distracted or diluted by nonrisks. Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity. Risk 
metalanguage offers a useful way of distinguishing a risk from its cause(s) and effect(s) by describing 
each risk using a three-part statement in the following form: “As a result of cause, risk may occur, 
which would lead to effect.” The relationship among cause, risk, and effect is shown in Figure X2-2.
Risks can be identified based on checklists and templates, individual assessments, group risk 
assessments, external risk identification, etc. Individual assessments are performed by a single 
individual, whether an expert, stakeholder, or other participant. Individual risk assessments can 
be combined to create the overall risk register. Outside risk assessments can be generated by the 
enterprise risk management (ERM) function within the organization or provided by an outside 
source, such as a customer or supplier.
Sections X2.2.1 through X2.2.14 describe some of the common techniques for risk identification.
X2.2.1 Assumptions and Constraints Analysis
Assumptions are used to determine risk impact. They are statements accepted as true but need to be 
validated and continually reviewed during the iteration process and throughout the risk management work 
related to portfolio, program, and project life cycles. This technique requires three steps: (1) list; (2) test the 
validity; and (3) identify impacts on the portfolio, program, or project. An example is shown in Figure X2-3.
Another way of approaching assumption and constraint analysis is to use the following logic sequence:
•	 List the assumption or constraint.
•	 Test the assumption or constraint by asking two questions:
o	 Could the assumption/constraint be false?
o	 If it were false, would one or more objectives be affected (positively or negatively)?
•	 Where both questions are answered “yes,” generate a risk, for example, in the form: <Assumption/
constraint> may prove false, leading to <effect on objective(s)>.

X2.2.2 Brainstorming
Brainstorming is a technique for generating spontaneous ideas either individually or from a group 
of people. When brainstorming is used as a group risk identification method, the ideas and thoughts 
of one individual serve to stimulate ideas in the other participants.
X2.2.3 Cause and Effect (Ishikawa) Diagrams
The cause and effect (Ishikawa) diagram, or fishbone diagram (see Figure X2-4), is used to display 
root causes of risks visually, allowing deeper understanding of the source and likelihood of potential 
problems. The content is organized into a branching diagram where the causes may themselves 
have multiple potential sources so that the overview on risk stimulates additional thinking. The 
cause and effect diagram is also used to identify quality-related problems.
X2.2.4 Checklists
Risk identification checklists can be developed based on historical information and knowledge 
that has been accumulated from previous, similar portfolios, programs, or projects and from

Appendix X2
other sources of information. The lowest level of a risk breakdown structure can also be used as a 
risk checklist. An example of a checklist is shown in Figure X2-5.
While a checklist can be quick and simple, it is impossible to build an exhaustive one. Care should be 
taken to explore items that do not appear on the checklist. The checklist should be reviewed during 
closure to improve it for future use.
X2.2.5 Delphi Technique
The Delphi technique uses a facilitated anonymous polling of subject matter experts to identify 
risks in their area of expertise. The facilitator gathers the experts’ initial responses and circulates 
them without attribution to the entire group. The group members may then revise their 
contributions based on those of others. The process often generates a consensus of the experts 
after a few iterations.
X2.2.6 Document Review
A structured review of documentation may be performed, including plans; assumptions; prior 
portfolio, program, or project files; and other information. The quality of the plans, as well as 
consistency between those plans and the assumptions, can be indicators of risk.
X2.2.7 Expert Judgment
Expert judgment is the contribution provided to risk identification based on expertise in a subject 
area, industry segment, organizational processes, etc.
X2.2.8 Facilitation
Facilitation is the ability to effectively guide a group event to a successful decision, solution, or 
conclusion. A facilitator ensures that there is effective participation and that all contributions 
are considered.

X2.2.9 Historical Information
Historical records and data from past portfolios, programs, and projects help to identify common 
risks and prevent repeating mistakes.
X2.2.10 Interviews
Interviewing experienced portfolio, program, or project participants, stakeholders, and subject matter 
experts can identify risks. Interviews are one of the main sources of risk identification data gathering.
X2.2.11 Prompt Lists
Prompt lists enumerate risk categories with the purpose of detecting the risks that are most relevant 
to the portfolio, program, or project. A prompt list can be useful as a framework for brainstorming 
and interviews. Categories of risks include:
•	 Technical risks,
•	 Organizational risks, and
•	 External risks.
There are different types of prompt lists. Figure X2-6 provides examples of some of the better-
known ones.
X2.2.12 Questionnaires
Questionnaire techniques encourage broad thinking to identify risks; however, questionnaires 
require quality questions to be effective.

X2.2.13 Root Cause Analysis
Root cause analysis helps to identify additional, dependent risks. The identified risks may be related 
because of their common root causes. Root cause analysis can be the basis for development of 
preemptive and comprehensive responses and can serve to reduce apparent complexity. One way 
of diagramming root cause is shown in Figure X2-7.
X2.2.14 SWOT Analysis
SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis is a technique that examines the 
initiative from each of the SWOT perspectives to increase the breadth of considered risks. It ensures 
equal focus on both threats and opportunities. This technique focuses on internal (organizational 
strengths and weaknesses) and external (opportunities and threats) factors. A method for 
structuring the results of a SWOT analysis is shown in Figure X2-8.

X2.2.15 Premortem
Premortem analysis is a strategic practice used to anticipate and address potential project failures. 
By envisioning the project’s hypothetical failure and working backward to identify plausible 
causes, teams can proactively address risks before they materialize. This technique fosters a 
comprehensive consideration of vulnerabilities, enabling teams to devise preemptive measures for 
risk management.
X2.3 Qualitative Risk Analysis
Qualitative risk analysis prioritizes the undifferentiated list of risks that have been identified in the 
Identify Risks process for further evaluation or for handling. Organizations tend to apply resources 
to those designated as high risk based on their priority, often indicated by the risk’s probability 
and impact characteristics. Qualitative risk analysis techniques are usually based on probability 
and impact but can also include additional prioritization variables. It is recommended to have a 
consistent, well-defined prioritization technique to maintain consistency among raters. An example 
of a rating definition schema is shown in Figure X2-9.
Sections X2.3.1 and X2.3.7 describe some common techniques for qualitative risk analysis.
X2.3.1 Affinity Diagrams
An affinity diagram is used to organize specific ideas or factors that contribute to a risk. It helps to 
sort risks by similarities or generic risk categories.
X2.3.2 Analytic Hierarchy Process
Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a matrix-method-based technique used to support a multicriteria 
decision-making process. It can also be used to identify risks. Even though there is an objective 
ranking where the subjectivity is minimized, the grouping is arbitrary. An example is shown in 
Figure X2-10.

X2.3.3 Influence Diagrams
An influence diagram is a diagrammatic representation of a situation showing the main entities, 
decision points, uncertainties, and outcomes, indicating the relationships (influences) among them. 
When combined with sensitivity analysis or Monte Carlo simulation, the influence diagram can 
identify risks to reveal their sources.
X2.3.4 Nominal Group Technique
The nominal group technique is an adaptation of brainstorming where participants share and 
discuss all issues before evaluation, with each participant participating equally in evaluation.

X2.3.5 Probability and Impact Matrixes
A probability and impact matrix allows the user to prioritize risks for further analysis or responses. 
It helps to distinguish between those risks that will have a minor impact on business activities and 
those that will have a major impact. It usually classifies risks according to their impact probability, 
such as very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. An example of a probability and impact matrix 
is shown in Figure X2-11.
X2.3.6 Risk Data Quality Analysis
Results of the risk analysis are only as good as the data collected. Review of the reliability and 
sufficiency of the data ensures that the analysis is based on high-quality information. Data that are 
deemed to be of lesser quality may be further researched or excluded from the risk analysis. Care 
should be taken when excluding poor-quality data to avoid a less-than-robust qualitative analysis.
X2.3.7 Assessment of Other Risk Parameters
Other characteristics of risk (in addition to probability and impact) can be considered when prioritizing 
risks for further analysis and action. These characteristics may include but are not limited to:
•	 Urgency. The period of time within which a response to a risk is to be implemented in order to 
be effective. A short period indicates high urgency.
•	 Proximity. The period of time before a risk may have an impact on one or more objectives. 
A short period indicates high proximity.
•	 Detectability. The ease with which the results of a risk occurring, or being about to occur, 
can be detected and recognized. When the risk occurrence can be detected easily, detectability 
is high.
•	 Dormancy. The period of time that may elapse after a risk has occurred before its impact is 
discovered. A short period indicates low dormancy.

Appendix X2
•	 Manageability. The ease with which a risk owner (or owning organization) can manage the 
occurrence or impact of a risk. When management is easy, manageability is high.
•	 Controllability. The degree to which a risk owner (or owning organization) is able to control 
the risk’s outcome. When the outcome can be controlled easily, controllability is high.
•	 Connectivity. The extent to which a risk is related to other individual risks. When a risk is 
connected to many other risks, connectivity is high.
•	 Strategic impact. The potential for a risk to have a positive or negative effect on the 
organization’s strategic goals. When a risk has a major effect on strategic goals, strategic impact 
is high.
•	 Stakeholder impact. The degree to which a risk is perceived to matter by one or more 
stakeholders. When a risk is perceived as very significant, stakeholder impact is high.
X2.3.8 System Dynamics
System dynamics (SD) is a particular application of influence diagrams and can be used to further 
identify risks within a given situation. The SD model represents entities and information flows, 
and analysis of the model can reveal feedback and feed-forward loops that lead to uncertainty or 
instability. In addition, the results of an SD analysis can show the impact of risk events on overall 
results. Analyses of changes in the model or assumptions can indicate the system’s sensitivity to 
specific events, some of which may be risks.
System dynamics exposes unexpected interrelationships among elements (feedback and 
feed-forward loops). It can generate counterintuitive perspectives not available through other 
techniques. The result is a view of the overall impact of all included risks.
X2.4 Quantitative Risk Analysis
Quantitative risk analysis is used to determine the overall risk to objectives when all risks potentially 
operate simultaneously. Techniques used appropriately for quantitative risk analysis have several 
characteristics: comprehensive risk representation, overall risk impact calculation, probability 
models, data-gathering capabilities, effective presentation of quantitative analysis results, 
and iteration capabilities. Quantitative risk analysis techniques enable representation of both 
opportunities and threats to the objectives.
Sections X2.4.1 through X2.4.7 describe some common techniques useful for quantitative 
risk analysis.
X2.4.1 Contingency Reserve Estimation
All of the conditional response plans, as well any of the residual risks will, if they occur, have 
an effect on objectives. An amount (time and cost) needs to be set aside to allow for these 
eventualities. This amount is made up of two components: (1) amounts to cover specific, 
approved conditional responses (e.g., contingency plans) and (2) amounts to address 
unspecified or passively accepted risks. Quantitative methods can be used to determine the 
amounts that should be set aside. These reserves are tracked and managed as part of the 
Monitor Risks process.

X2.4.2 Decision Tree Analysis
Decision tree analysis is used to determine partial and global probabilities of occurrence. It is a tree-
like model that calculates the expected monetary value (see Section X2.4.4) of different possibilities 
by probability of occurrence. A simple example of a decision tree is shown in Figure X2-12.
X2.4.3 Estimating Techniques Applied to Probability and Impact
The probability of a risk occurring can be specified in several different ways. One common way is to 
assign levels of risk probability by ranges of probability. One benefit of this approach is that the subject 
matter experts only need to assess a risk’s probability within a range rather than as a specific value.
Examples of impact-level definitions are very work specific. The values used to specify the level of 
impact from very low to very high (if a 5×5 matrix is being used) should be:
•	 Designated as higher impact for threats or opportunities as they move from very low to very 
high for a specific objective,

Note 2: The decision tree shows how to make a decision between alternative capital strategies (represented as “decision  
 
nodes”) when the environment contains uncertain elements (represented as “chance nodes”).
Note 3: Here, a decision is being made whether to invest $120M to build a new plant or to instead invest only $50M 
 
to upgrade the existing plant. For each decision, the demand (which is uncertain, and therefore represents a
 
“chance node”) must be accounted for. For example, strong demand leads to $200M revenue with the new plant
 
but only $120M for the upgraded plant, perhaps due to capacity limitations of the upgraded plant. The end of
 
each branch shows the net effect of the payoffs minus costs. For each decision branch, all effects are added (see
 
shaded areas) to determine the overall expected monetary value (EMV) of the decision. Remember to account for
 
the investment costs. From the calculations in the shaded areas, the upgraded plant has a higher EMV of $46M—
 
also the EMV of the overall decision. (This choice also represents the lowest risk, avoiding the worst case possible  
 
outcome of a loss of $30M).

•	 Defined by the organization as causing the same amount of pain or gain for each level across 
objectives, and
•	 Tailored or scaled by stakeholders to the specific work. The definitions, appropriately tailored, 
can be used for opportunities and threats.
If a risk’s impact is uncertain and could be assigned to more than one level of impact (e.g., from 
moderate to high), the analyst may choose to assign the risk to the impact level that represents 
the expected or average impact. Alternatively, the risk may be flagged for extra analysis in order to 
reduce the range of uncertainty to fit within a single range.
X2.4.4 Expected Monetary Value
Expected monetary value (EMV) is a statistical technique that is used to quantify risks, which in turn 
assists the manager in calculating the contingency reserve. EMV is a calculation of a value, such as 
weighted average or expected cost or benefit, when the outcomes are uncertain. All reasonable 
alternative outcomes are identified. Their probabilities of occurring (summing to 100%) and their 
values are estimated. The EMV calculation is made for the entire event by weighting the individual 
possible outcomes by their probabilities of occurring. The formula is:
Expected monetary value (EMV) = Probability × Impact
X2.4.5 Failure Modes and Effects Analysis/Fault Tree Analysis
Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) or fault tree analysis uses a model structured to identify the 
various elements that can cause system failure by themselves, or in combination with others, based on 
the logic of the system. Fault tree analysis is often used in engineering contexts. It can be adapted for 
use to identify risks by analyzing how risk impacts may arise, or the probability of failure (or of reliability, 
mean time between failure, etc.) of the overall system, indicating the level of quality of the system or 
product. If the level of reliability is not acceptable, the fault tree can indicate where the system can be 
made more reliable; therefore, it is useful in the design and engineering phase of a program or project.
Failure modes and effects analysis assesses and analyzes the potential reliability of a system and/or 
products. It is used together with failure mode effect and criticality analysis as part of the general 
program to assess reliability of a system and potential failure modes.
Using historical data, the analysis of similar products/services, warranty data, customer data 
complaints, and any other information available may lead to the use of inferential statistics, 
mathematical modeling, simulations, concurrent engineering, and reliability engineering to identify 
and define possible failures.
Failure mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA) is the logical extension of FMEA. It evaluates the 
criticality and probability of occurrence of the failure modes.
X2.4.6 Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation is a technique to simulate probability distribution for a risk on an objective. 
The statistical method samples events to determine the average behavior of a system.
Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical analysis technique that can be applied in situations in which 
there are uncertain estimates, with the aim of reducing the level of uncertainty through a series

of simulations. In this sense, it can be applied in the analysis of risks associated with a particular 
objective. For each of the variables, Monte Carlo simulations do not provide a single estimate, but 
a range of possible estimates associated with each estimate and the level of probability that the 
estimate is accurate (confidence level) as shown in Figure X2-13.
X2.4.7 Program or Project Evaluation and Review Technique
Program or project evaluation and review technique (PERT) is a time-based technique that can be 
used to quantify risks at a given point in the development of a program or project.
X2.5 Plan Risk Responses
Plan Risk Responses develops the set of actions required to consider the risks and their 
characteristics and integrates them into corresponding plans and budgets. The resultant plan 
should satisfy the risk appetites and attitudes of the key stakeholders. There are three categories of 
techniques, as follows:
•	 Creativity techniques to identify potential responses,
•	 Decision-support techniques for determining the optimal potential response, and
•	 Implementation techniques designed to turn a risk response into action.

Appendix X2
Respectively, these categories of techniques can be used to identify potential responses, select the 
most appropriate response to translate strategy into planning, and assign corresponding actions.
Identifying potential responses by a variety of creativity techniques is quite similar to risk 
identification techniques (see Section X2-2). Decision-support techniques assist in examining 
the trade-offs among risk response strategies. Such techniques also assist in choosing between 
preemptive prevention and contingency responses based on triggers.
Sections X2.5.1 through X2.5.5 describe a few decision-support techniques that may be used for the 
Plan Risk Response process.
X2.5.1 Contingency Planning
For specific (normally high-impact) risks, the risk owner may choose to assemble a team to develop 
a response as if the risk had genuinely happened. The corresponding plan, with the supporting 
information, is then documented and approved by management or the sponsor. This approval includes 
authorization to deploy the corresponding resources if the predefined trigger conditions arise.
X2.5.2 Force Field Analysis
Force field analysis is typically used in the change management context. It can be adapted for risk 
response planning by identifying driving forces (forces for change) and restraining forces (forces 
against change) that currently affect achievement of an objective. Risk responses can then be 
modeled based on the net result of the forces as shown in Figure X2-14.

X2.5.3 Multicriteria Selection Technique
Criteria for deciding whether to choose a specific risk response from among several options include 
cost, schedule, technical requirements, etc., as well as the risk attributes, such as the type of risk, 
magnitude of probability, and impact. Multicriteria selection could be weighted to reflect the 
importance of various criterion as shown in Figure X2-15.
X2.5.4 Scenario Analysis
Scenario analysis for risk response planning involves defining several plausible alternative scenarios. 
Each scenario may require different risk responses that can be described and evaluated for their 
cost and effectiveness. If the organization can choose among several scenarios, the alternatives, 
including responses, can be compared. If the scenarios are out of the control of the organization, 
the analysis can lead to effective and necessary contingency planning.
Scenarios usually include optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic assessments. The 
representation of optimistic and pessimistic scenarios can be useful in providing managers 
with a certain sensitivity to the upside and downside potential associated with a portfolio, 
program, or project.
X2.5.5 Simulation
Simulation is a technique to estimate the benefits and implications of different response plans 
versus the efforts and costs required to implement them. Simulations can also help analyze 
the possible implications to the critical chain in projects when implementing different risk 
response options.
X2.6 Response Plan Implementation
The most common technique to turn preventative response plans into action is adding them to the 
portfolio, program, or project management plan. While some planning techniques can keep track 
of and differentiate between tasks and actions that originated from response plans, some planning 
techniques will not differentiate between risk response tasks and other tasks.

Appendix X2
X2.7 Monitor Risks
Monitor Risks provides the assurance that risk responses are being applied, verifies whether they 
are effective, and as necessary, initiates corrective actions. Sections X2.7.1 through X2.7.10 describe 
techniques for monitoring risks during the entire portfolio, program, or project life cycle.
X2.7.1 Data Analytics
Data analytics supports the exploration of known risk types by analyzing related documentation 
and related data for applicability to a specific portfolio, program, or project. In direct data 
analytics, the question and types of risks explored are predefined, as are the relationships 
among different types of risks and their causes and effects. The use of big data, advanced 
analytics, or artificial intelligence capabilities to explore unknown types of risks are forms of 
advanced data analytics.
X2.7.2 Reserve Analysis
Reserve analysis is an analytical technique to determine the essential features and relationships 
of components in the work management plan to establish a reserve for the schedule duration, 
budget, estimated cost, or funds. Tracking the state of the reserve through execution provides 
summary information as to the evolution of the status of the corresponding risks. This 
information can be useful when reporting up through the organization’s management structure. 
In addition, once a risk occurs or ceases to be current (i.e., when it can no longer impact), the 
corresponding reserve needs to be reviewed to assess whether it still provides the agreed-upon 
level of confidence.
X2.7.3 Residual Impact Analysis
Response plan implementation could lead to residual risks, emergent risks, or secondary risks.
X2.7.4 Risk Audit
Risk audits are carried out in order to evaluate the following:
•	 Risk management rules are being carried out as specified, and
•	 Risk management rules are adequate for controlling the work.
Section 7.4 introduces project risk management controls for project risk management governance. 
These project risk management controls then become criteria against which an audit is conducted.
X2.7.5 Risk Breakdown Structure
The risk breakdown structure (RBS) is a hierarchical framework of potential sources of risk. An 
organization may develop a generic or specific RBS. The RBS helps to identify specific risks in relation 
to its category and offers a framework for other risk identification techniques such as brainstorming. 
An RBS helps to ensure coverage of all types of risk and tests for blind spots or omissions. An 
example of a generic RBS for a project is shown in Figure X2-16.

Risk reassessment requires the following activities to be estimated and validated again to ensure 
effective control:
•	 Identifying new risks,
•	 Evaluating current risks,
•	 Evaluating the risk management processes, and
•	 Closing risks.
X2.7.7 Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis is the evaluation of the effect on a variable by one or more influencing variables. 
Often used as a technique in monitoring risks, it serves to identify the possible impact on a given 
objective should one or more risks materialize.

Appendix X2
X2.7.8 Status Meetings
Status meetings include the review of all open risks and trigger conditions that have occurred, 
leading to risks becoming issues. Risks responded to in the past period; effectiveness of the actions 
taken; impacts on the portfolio, program, or project; and lessons learned are formally recorded in a 
knowledge management system.
X2.7.9 Trend Analysis
Trend analysis evaluates how the risk profile changes over time, whether or not the previous actions 
resulted in the expected effect, and whether or not additional actions are required.
X2.7.10 Variance Analysis
The analysis of variances compares planned versus actual results. When the variances are increasing, 
there is increased uncertainty and risk. Outcomes from this analysis may forecast any potential for 
future deviation from the baseline plan prior to completion. Deviation from the baseline plan may 
indicate the potential impact of threats or opportunities.
X2.8 Risk Management Techniques Recap
Table X2-1 lists techniques for carrying out risk management in portfolios, programs, and projects. 
The list is not exhaustive, and it is not necessary to use all of the techniques.
The column headings list the risk management processes discussed in Section 4 of the practice 
guide and indicate a few of the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. Within each cell, the 
letters indicate a subjective evaluation of the relevance of each technique for the risk management 
process. In Table X2-1, the “C” stands for core and means that the use of that technique is recognized 
as useful in the context of a given process; the “S” stands for supportive and means that the 
technique can provide some useful information for a given process.

• The best decision may change with plausible  
 
changes in the input data, meaning that the  
 
answer may not be stable
• The organization may not make decisions based  
 
on a linear expected monetary value basis, but  
 
rather on a nonlinear utility function; utility  
 
functions are difﬁcult to specify
• Decision tree analysis of complicated situations  
 
requires specialized software
• There may be some resistance to using technical  
 
approaches to decision-making
• Limited to technical risks
• Dependent on actual expertise of experts
• May take longer time than available due to  
 
iterations of the experts’ inputs
• Limited to risks contained in documentation

• Prevents making the same mistakes or missing the  
 
same opportunities
• Enhances the organizational process assets
• Exposes key risk drivers
• Can generate counterintuitive insights not available  
 
through other techniques
• Addresses risks in detail
• Generates engagement of stakeholders
• Used primarily for project schedule and cost risk  
 
analysis in strategic decisions
• Allows all speciﬁed risks to vary simultaneously
• Calculates quantitative estimates of overall risk;  
 
reﬂects the reality that several risks may occur  
 
together
• Provides answers to questions such as: (1) How  
 
likely is the base plan to be successful? (2) How  
 
much contingency in time and cost do we need to  
 
achieve our desired level of conﬁdence? (3) Which  
 
activities are important in determining the overall  
 
risk?
• Provides a means of selecting the responses that  
 
best support the full set of objectives
• Encourages and allows all participants to   
 
contribute
• Allows for different levels of competence in  
 
common language
• Provides ideal base for afﬁnity diagramming  
 
(grouping by risk categories for use in the risk  
 
breakdown structure and root cause analysis)
• Focuses on threats; not so useful for opportunities
• Requires expert tools not generally available to  
 
others
• Time-consuming and complex technique
• Usually only applied to a single objective, so does  
 
not provide whole view
• Limited to those risks that occurred previously
• Information is frequently incomplete: lacks detail  
 
of past risks and may not include details of  
 
successful resolution; ineffective strategies are  
 
rarely documented
• Requires disciplined thinking
• Not always easy to determine appropriate   
 
structure
• Time-consuming
• Raises nonrisks, concerns, issues, worries, etc.;  
 
therefore, requires ﬁltering
• Schedules are not simple and often cannot be  
 
used in simulation without signiﬁcant debugging  
 
by an expert scheduler
• Quality of the input data depends heavily on the  
 
expert judgment and the effort and expertise of  
 
the risk analyst
• Simulation is sometimes resisted by management  
 
as being unnecessary or too sophisticated  
 
compared to other, more traditional techniques
• Monte Carlo simulation requires specialized  
 
software, which must be acquired and learned,  
 
causing a barrier to its use
• Produces unrealistic results unless input data  
 
include both threats and opportunities
• Can give counterintuitive results
• Can lead to frustration in dominant members who  
 
feel it is moving slowly

Technique
• Provides a time-based view of risks
• Useful for observing the degree to which a risk  
 
takes on greater signiﬁcance at a given point in  
 
time
• Allows the organization to prioritize the risks for  
 
further analysis (e.g., quantitative) or risk response
• Reﬂects the organization’s level of risk threshold
• Ensures coverage of all types of risk
• Stimulates creativity
• Encourages broad thinking to identify risks
• Provides a means of tracking spending and  
 
releasing contingency amounts as risks expire; can  
 
be applied to schedule reserves in the same way
• Gives early warning of the need to communicate  
 
with sponsor
• Provides for further analysis of potential risks after  
 
initial treatment is applied
• Provides a formal assessment of the compliance  
 
with the approach speciﬁed in the risk  
 
 
management plan
• Offers a framework for other risk identiﬁcation  
 
techniques such as brainstorming
• Ensures coverage of all types of risk
• Tests for blind spots or omissions
• Promotes consideration of the validity of risk  
 
characteristics
• Forces a review of the risks when it becomes  
 
necessary so that the risk register remains current
• Allows identiﬁcation of additional, dependent risks
• Allows the organization to identify risks that may  
 
be related because of their common root causes
• Basis for development of preemptive and   
 
comprehensive responses
• Can serve to reduce apparent complexity
• Does not have a deﬁned measure of impact
• Does not explicitly handle other factors such as  
 
urgency or manageability that may partly   
 
determine a risk’s ranking
• Range of uncertainty in the assessment of a risk’s  
 
probability or impact may overlap a boundary
• Topics can be too abstract
• Success depends on the quality of the questions
• Limited to the topics covered by the questions
• Can be a simple reformatting of a checklist
• Could lead to unwarranted focus on cost   
 
dimension
• Attention to overall measure of reserve depletion  
 
may hide detailed risks
• May promote focusing on risks that do not have  
 
substantial impact potential
• Can be disruptive and taken as too judgmental to  
 
the team
• Can lead to complacency where the fact that the  
 
risk is recorded is deemed adequate risk   
 
management
• May be difﬁcult to quantify the accuracy of the  
 
data
 
• Takes time and effort
• Most risk management techniques are organized  
 
by individual risk; this structure is not conducive to  
 
identifying the root causes
• Can oversimplify and hide the existence of other  
 
potential causes
• There may be no valid strategy available for  
 
addressing the root cause once it has been  
 
identiﬁed

Appendix X3
Appendix X3 
Risk Classification
Potential risks can be classified into one of four quadrants based on the degree of available 
information, ambiguity, and variability. Organizations work to reduce the degree of unknown 
factors so they can be progressively converted to known-knowns or, at least, known-unknowns. 
This appendix details this concept, which was introduced in Section 3 of this standard.
•	 Known-known. A known-known is a fact, not a risk. These facts are typically identified as part 
of the requirements and scope. The entity working on the endeavor is aware of these facts, 
which are incorporated into the portfolio, program, or project scope.
•	 Known-unknown. A known-unknown is an identified risk. The entity working on the endeavor 
is aware of the uncertain event and the potential consequences. Known-unknown risks are 
identified and proactively managed.
•	 Unknown-known. An unknown-known is a hidden fact. Knowledge about the fact may 
exist; however, the entity may not be aware of it at the time of the endeavor. An example of 
an unknown-known is a hidden or ignored assumption. The identification, assessment, and 
development of a strong understanding of unknown-known risks occur over time. For complex 
and innovative activities, there is a high degree of guesswork in which risks can be identified, 
but with limited visibility. Unknown-knowns are typically addressed through progressive risk 
elaboration integrated with execution of the endeavor.
•	 Unknown-unknown. Unknown-unknown risks may be emergent risks that are essentially 
unknowable within the context of portfolio, program, and project management. That lack of 
knowledge makes any type of evaluation or exploration impossible. Unknown-unknowns can 
be managed through organizational resilience. Due to unpredictability, resilient organizations 
promote research, raise awareness, encourage teams to question the status quo, and increase 
the flow of information. These actions stretch the boundaries of influence and prepare 
organizations to better respond to and recover from such events.
