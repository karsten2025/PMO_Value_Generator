PREFACE
The Project Management Institute and Agile Alliance® chartered this practice guide to create a greater 
understanding of agile approaches in their communities. The vision for this practice guide is to equip project 
teams with tools, situational guidelines, and an understanding of the available agile techniques and approaches 
to enable better results.
Project teams are using agile approaches in a variety of industries beyond software development. Both 
organizations realize that expansion has created a need for a common language, open mindedness, and the 
willingness to be flexible in how products and deliverables are brought to market. In addition, both organizations 
realize there are multiple ways to achieve successful delivery. There are a broad range of tools, techniques, and 
frameworks; teams have choices for approaches and practices that fit their project and the organizational culture 
in order to achieve the desired outcome.
The Agile Practice Guide core committee members are from varying backgrounds and use various approaches. 
Some of the committee members are consultants and some work inside organizations. All have worked in agile 
ways for many years.

INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Agile Practice Guide! This guide was developed as a collaborative effort by the Project Management 
Institute (PMI) and Agile Alliance®. The members of the core writing team who developed this practice guide included 
volunteers from both organizations, drawing on subject matter expertise from a broad range of current practitioners and 
leaders from a diverse range of backgrounds, beliefs, and cultures.
This practice guide provides practical guidance geared toward project leaders and team members adapting to an 
agile approach in planning and executing projects. While our core writing team recognizes there is staunch support 
to use predictive approaches and conversely, passion around shifting to an agile mindset, values, and principles, this 
practice guide covers a practical approach to project agility. This practice guide represents a bridge to understanding 
the pathway from a predictive approach to an agile approach. In fact, there are similar activities between the two, such 
as planning, that are handled differently but occur in both environments.
Our core writing team used an agile mindset to collaborate and manage the development of this first edition of the 
practice guide. As technology and culture changes, future updates and refinements to the practice guide will reflect 
current approaches.
Our core team adopted a more informal, relaxed writing style for this practice guide than is typical for PMI standards. 
The guide incorporates new elements, such as tips, sidebars, and case studies to better illustrate key points and 
concepts. Our team intends for these changes to make this practice guide more readable and user-friendly.
This practice guide goes beyond addressing the use of agile in the computer software development industry, because 
agile has expanded into non-software development environments. Manufacturing, education, healthcare and other 
industries are becoming agile to varying degrees and this use beyond software is within the scope of this practice guide.

Section 1
So why an Agile Practice Guide and why now? Project teams have used 
agile techniques and approaches in various forms for at least several decades. 
The Agile Manifesto [1]1 expressed definitive values and principles of agile 
as the use of agile gained substantial momentum (see Section 2.1). Today, 
project leaders and teams find themselves in an environment disrupted by 
exponential advances in technology and demands from customers for more 
immediate delivery of value. Agile techniques and approaches effectively 
manage disruptive technologies. In addition, the first principle of agile places 
customer satisfaction as the highest priority and is key in delivering products 
and services that delight customers (see Section 2.1). Rapid and transparent 
customer feedback loops are readily available with the widespread use 
of social media. Therefore, in order to stay competitive and relevant, 
organizations can no longer be internally focused but rather need to focus 
outwardly to the customer experience.
1 The numbers in brackets refer to the list of references at the end of this practice guide.
Agile-Based Learning
Education is a prime and fertile 
ground to expand agile practices 
beyond 
software 
development. 
Teachers in middle schools, high 
schools, and universities around the 
world are beginning to use agile to 
create a culture of learning. Agile 
techniques are used to provide focus 
on prioritizing competing priorities. 
Face-to-face interaction, meaningful 
learning, self-organizing teams, and 
incremental and/or iterative learning 
that exploit the imagination are all 
agile principles that can change the 
mindset in the classroom and advance 
educational goals (Briggs, 2014).*

Disruptive technologies are rapidly changing the playing field by 
decreasing the barriers to entry. More mature organizations are increasingly 
prone to being highly complex and potentially slow to innovate, and lag 
behind in delivering new solutions to their customers. These organizations 
find themselves competing with smaller organizations and startups that 
are able to rapidly produce products that fit customer needs. This speed of 
change will continue to drive large organizations to adopt an agile mindset 
in order to stay competitive and keep their existing market share.
The Agile Practice Guide is project-focused and addresses project life 
cycle selection, implementing agile, and organizational considerations 
for agile projects. Organizational change management (OCM) is essential 
for implementing or transforming practices but, since OCM is a discipline 
within itself, it is outside the scope of this practice guide. Those seeking 
guidance in OCM may refer to Managing Change in Organizations— 
A Practice Guide [2].
Additional items that are in scope and out of scope for this practice guide 
are listed in Table 1-1.
Disruptive Technology
Disruptive 
technology 
is 
especially enabled by the transition 
to cloud computing. Companies 
across the globe are leveraging 
the model for quick and cheap 
access to computing resources 
and to gain entry into traditional 
markets. Cloud computing requires 
a reduced upfront payment, but is 
paid over time via a subscription 
service, based upon a pay-as-you-
go or pay-what-you-use model. 
Updated applications, infrastructure, 
and platforms are released into the 
cloud in an iterative and incremental 
fashion, 
keeping 
pace 
with 
improvements to technology and 
evolving customer demand.

AN INTRODUCTION TO AGILE
2.1 Definable Work vs. High-Uncertainty Work
Project work ranges from definable work to high-uncertainty work. Definable work projects are characterized by clear 
procedures that have proved successful on similar projects in the past. The production of a car, electrical appliance, or 
home after the design is complete are examples of definable work. The production domain and processes involved are 
usually well understood and there are typically low levels of execution uncertainty and risk.
New design, problem solving, and not-done-before work is exploratory. It requires subject matter experts to 
collaborate and solve problems to create a solution. Examples of people encountering high-uncertainty work include 
software systems engineers, product designers, doctors, teachers, lawyers, and many problem-solving engineers. As 
more definable work is automated, project teams are undertaking more high-uncertainty work projects that require the 
techniques described in this practice guide.
High-uncertainty projects have high rates of change, complexity, and risk. These characteristics can present problems 
for traditional predictive approaches that aim to determine the bulk of the requirements upfront and control changes 
through a change request process. Instead, agile approaches were created to explore feasibility in short cycles and 
quickly adapt based on evaluation and feedback.

Thought leaders in the software industry formalized the agile movement in 2001 with the publication of the Manifesto 
for Agile Software Development (see Figure 2-1).
Figure 2-1. The Four Values of the Agile Manifesto
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and 
helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the 
items on the left more.

Twelve clarifying principles flowed from these values as shown in Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2. The Twelve Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous
 
delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes
 
harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months,
 
with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and
 
support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a
 
development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and
 
users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing 
 
teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then
 
tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Section 2
Although originating in the software industry, these principles have since spread to many other industries.
This embodiment of mindset, values, and principles defines what constitutes an agile approach. The various agile 
approaches in use today share common roots with the agile mindset, value, and principles. This relationship is shown 
in Figure 2-3.
Figure 2-3. The Relationship Between the Agile Manifesto Values, Principles, and Common Practices
As shown in Figure 2-3, the model, inspired by Ahmed Sidky, articulates agile as a mindset defined by the Agile 
Manifesto values, guided by the Agile Manifesto principles, and enabled by various practices. It is worth noting that 
while the term “agile” became popularized after the Manifesto, the approaches and techniques being used by project 
teams today existed before the Agile Manifesto by many years and, in some cases, decades.
Agile is a mindset defined by values, guided by principles, and manifested through 
many different practices. Agile practitioners select practices based on their needs.

Figure 2-4. Agile is a Blanket Term for Many Approaches
Agile approaches and agile methods are umbrella terms that cover a 
variety of frameworks and methods. Figure 2-4 places agile in context and 
visualizes it as a blanket term, referring to any kind of approach, technique, 
framework, method, or practice that fulfills the values and principles of the 
Agile Manifesto. Figure 2-4 also shows agile and the Kanban Method as 
subsets of lean. This is because they are named instances of lean thinking 
that share lean concepts such as: “focus on value,” “small batch sizes,” 
and “elimination of waste.”

Is agile an approach, a method, a 
practice, a technique, or a framework? 
Any or all of these terms could 
apply depending on the situation. 
This practice guide, uses the term 
“approach” unless one of the other 
terms is obviously more correct.

Section 2
In general, there are two strategies to fulfill agile values and principles. The first is to adopt a formal agile approach, 
intentionally designed and proven to achieve desired results. Then take time to learn and understand the agile approaches 
before changing or tailoring them. Premature and haphazard tailoring can minimize the effects of the approach and thus 
limit benefits. (See Appendix X2 for Tailoring Considerations).
The second strategy is to implement changes to project practices in a manner that fits the project context to achieve 
progress on a core value or principle. Use timeboxes to create features, or specific techniques to iteratively refine 
features. Consider dividing up one large project into several releases, if that works for the specific project context. 
Implement changes that will help the project succeed—the changes do not need to be part of the organization’s formal 
practices. The end goal is not to be agile for its own sake, but rather to deliver a continuous flow of value to customers 
and achieve better business outcomes.
2.3 Lean and the Kanban Method
One way to think about the relationship between lean, agile, and the Kanban Method is to consider agile and the 
Kanban Method as descendants of lean thinking. In other words, lean thinking is a superset, sharing attributes with 
agile and Kanban.
This shared heritage is very similar and focuses on delivering value, respect for people, minimizing waste, being 
transparent, adapting to change, and continuously improving. Project teams sometimes find it useful to blend various 
methods—whatever works for the organization or team is what should be done regardless of its origin. The objective is 
the best outcome regardless of the approach used.
The Kanban Method is inspired by the original lean-manufacturing system and used specifically for knowledge work. 
It emerged in the mid-2000s as an alternative to the agile methods that were prevalent at the time.

13
The Kanban Method is less prescriptive than some agile approaches and less disruptive, as it is the original “start-
where-you-are” approach. Project teams can begin applying the Kanban Method with relative ease and progress toward 
other agile approaches if that is what they deem necessary or appropriate. For more details on the Kanban Method, see 
Annex A3 on Overview of Agile and Lean Frameworks.
2.4 Uncertainty, Risk, and Life Cycle Selection
Some projects have considerable uncertainty around project requirements and how to fulfill those requirements using 
current knowledge and technology. These uncertainties can contribute to high rates of change and project complexity. 
These characteristics are illustrated in Figure 2-5.
As project uncertainty increases, so too does the risk of rework and the need to use a different approach. To mitigate 
the impact of these risks, teams select life cycles that allow them to tackle projects with high amounts of uncertainty 
via small increments of work.
Teams can verify their work when they use small increments and can change what they do next. When teams deliver 
small increments, they are better able to understand the true customer requirements faster and more accurately than 
with a static written specification.
C A S E
There is and probably always will be a lot of discussion around the Kanban Method and whether 
it belongs to the lean or agile movement. It was conceived in and around lean manufacturing, 
but is widely used in agile settings.

Teams can plan and manage projects with clear and stable requirements and clear technical challenges with little 
difficulty. However, as the uncertainty in the project increases, the likelihood of changes, wasted work, and rework also 
increases, which is costly and time consuming.

Some teams have evolved project life cycles to use iterative and incremental approaches. Many teams discover that 
when they explore the requirements iteratively and deliver more often incrementally, the teams adapt to changes more 
easily. These iterative and incremental approaches reduce waste and rework because the teams gain feedback. These 
approaches use:
u
u Very short feedback loops,
u
u Frequent adaptation of process,
u
u Reprioritization,
u
u Regularly updated plans, and
u
u Frequent delivery.
TIP
What do simple, complicated, and complex projects mean? Consider large projects, such as the 
Boston Big Dig construction project. On the surface, the project seemed fairly straightforward: move 
the elevated highway underground. There was high agreement on the requirements (see the Y axis in 
Figure 2-5). There was low uncertainty on how the project would proceed until the project started. And, 
as is the case for many large projects, the project encountered surprises along the way.
When a team works on a project where there is little opportunity for interim deliverables or little 
opportunity for prototyping, the team most likely will use a predictive life cycle to manage it. The team can 
adapt to what it discovers, but will not be able to use agile approaches to manage the iterative discovery 
of requirements or incremental deliverables for feedback.
The Big Dig project was not simple by any means. However, many projects that start out in the lower 
left part of the Stacey Complexity Model have no real means of moving to other approaches. Assess the 
project, both in the requirements and the means of delivery, to determine the best approach for the life 
cycle of the project.

Section 2
These iterative, incremental, and agile approaches work well for projects that involve new or novel tools, techniques, 
materials, or application domains. (Refer to Section 3 on Life Cycle Selection). They also work well for projects that:
u
u Require research and development;
u
u Have high rates of change;
u
u Have unclear or unknown requirements, uncertainty, or risk; or
u
u Have a final goal that is hard to describe.
By building a small increment and then testing and reviewing it, the team can explore uncertainty at a low cost in 
a short time, reduce risk, and maximize business value delivery. This uncertainty may be centered on suitability and 
requirements (is the right product being built?); technical feasibility and performance (can this product be built this 
way?); or process and people (is this an effective way for the team to work?). All three of these characteristics—product 
specification, production capability, and process suitability—typically have elements of high uncertainty.
However, iterative and incremental approaches have their limits of applicability. When both technology uncertainty 
and requirements uncertainty are very high (the top right of Figure 2-5), the project moves beyond complex to chaotic. 
In order for the project to become reliably possible, it needs one of the uncertainty variables to be contained.

LIFE CYCLE SELECTION
Projects come in many shapes and there are a variety of ways to undertake 
them. Project teams need awareness of the characteristics and options 
available to select the approach most likely to be successful for the situation.
This practice guide refers to four types of life cycles, defined as follows:
u
u Predictive life cycle. A more traditional approach, with the bulk 
of planning occurring upfront, then executing in a single pass; 
a sequential process.
u
u Iterative life cycle. An approach that allows feedback for unfinished 
work to improve and modify that work.
u
u Incremental life cycle. An approach that provides finished 
deliverables that the customer may be able to use immediately.
u
u Agile life cycle. An approach that is both iterative and incremental 
to refine work items and deliver frequently.
What to Call Non-Agile 
Approaches?
There is no single term that is 
universally used to describe non-agile 
approaches. Initially, the practice 
guide used the term plan-driven to 
describe the emphasis on an upfront 
plan and then execution of that 
plan. Some people prefer the terms 
waterfall or serial to describe this 
life cycle. In the end, we settled on 
the term predictive since it is used in 
A Guide to the Project Management 
Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) 
[3] and the Software Extension to the 
PMBOK® Guide Fifth Edition [4].
Many 
organizations 
do 
not 
experience either of these extremes 
and instead occupy some middle 
ground. That is natural, but we still 
need a way to talk about both ends 
of the spectrum. If agile is at one end, 
we call the other end predictive.

Section 3
3.1 Characteristics of Project Life Cycles
Table 3-1 summarizes the characteristics of the four life cycle categories covered in this practice guide.
Table 3-1. Characteristics of Four Categories of Life Cycles
It is important to note that all projects have these characteristics—no project is completely devoid of considerations 
around requirements, delivery, change, and goals. A project’s inherent characteristics determine which life cycle is the 
best fit for that project.
Another way to understand how project life cycles vary is by using a continuum ranging from predictive cycles on one 
end, to agile cycles on the other end, with more iterative or incremental cycles in the middle.
Figure X3-1 of Appendix X3 of the PMBOK® Guide – Sixth Edition displays the continuum as a flat line. This view 
emphasizes the shifting of project characteristics from one end to the other. Another way to visualize the continuum is 
with a two-dimensional square, as shown in Figure 3-1.

Figure 3-1. The Continuum of Life Cycles
No life cycle can be perfect for all projects. Instead, each project finds a spot on the continuum that provides an 
optimum balance of characteristics for its context. Specifically,
u
u Predictive life cycles. Take advantage of things that are known and proven. This reduced uncertainty and 
complexity allows teams to segment work into a sequence of predictable groupings.
u
u Iterative life cycles. Allow feedback on partially completed or unfinished work to improve and modify that work.
u
u Incremental life cycles. Provide finished deliverables that the customer may be able to use immediately.
u
u Agile life cycles. Leverage both the aspects of iterative and incremental characteristics. When teams use agile 
approaches, they iterate over the product to create finished deliverables. The team gains early feedback and 
provides customer visibility, confidence, and control of the product. Because the team can release earlier, the 
project may provide an earlier return on investment because the team delivers the highest value work first.

Section 3
3.1.1 Characteristics of Predictive Life Cycles
Predictive life cycles expect to take advantage of high certainty around 
firm requirements, a stable team, and low risk. As a result, project activities 
often execute in a serial manner, as shown in Figure 3-2.
In order to achieve this approach, the team requires detailed plans to 
know what to deliver and how. These projects succeed when other potential 
changes are restricted (e.g., requirements changes; project team members 
change what the team delivers). Team leaders aim to minimize change for 
the predictive project.
When the team creates detailed requirements and plans at the beginning 
of the project, they can articulate the constraints. The team can then use 
those constraints to manage risk and cost. As the team progresses through 
the detailed plan, they monitor and control changes that might affect the 
scope, schedule, or budget.
By emphasizing a departmentally efficient, serialized sequence of work, 
predictive projects do not typically deliver business value until the end of 
the project. If the predictive project encounters changes or disagreements 
with the requirements, or if the technological solution is no longer 
straightforward, the predictive project will incur unanticipated costs.
Planning is always there
A key thing to remember about 
life cycles is that each of them 
share the element of planning. 
What differentiates a life cycle is 
not whether planning is done, but 
rather how much planning is done 
and when.
At the predictive end of the 
continuum, the plan drives the work. 
As much planning as is possible is 
performed upfront. Requirements 
are identified in as much detail as 
possible. The team estimates when 
they can deliver which deliverables 
and 
performs 
comprehensive 
procurement activities.
In iterative approaches, prototypes 
and proofs are also planned, but 
the outputs are intended to modify 
the plans created in the beginning. 
Earlier reviews of unfinished work 
help inform future project work.
Meanwhile, incremental initiatives 
plan to deliver successive subsets 
of the overall project. Teams may 
plan several successive deliveries 
in advance or only one at a time. 
The deliveries inform the future 
project work.
Agile projects also plan. The key 
difference is that the team plans 
and replans as more information 
becomes available from review of 
frequent deliveries. Regardless of 
the project life cycle, the project 
requires planning.

Figure 3-2. Predictive Life Cycle
3.1.2 Characteristics of Iterative Life Cycles
Iterative life cycles improve the product or result through successive prototypes or proofs of concept. Each new 
prototype yields new stakeholder feedback and team insights. Then, the team incorporates the new information by 
repeating one or more project activities in the next cycle. Teams may use timeboxing on a given iteration for a few 
weeks, gather insights, and then rework the activity based on those insights. In that way, iterations help identify and 
reduce uncertainty in the project.
Projects benefit from iterative life cycles when complexity is high, when the project incurs frequent changes, or when 
the scope is subject to differing stakeholders’ views of the desired final product. Iterative life cycles may take longer 
because they are optimized for learning rather than speed of delivery.
Figure 3-3 illustrates some elements of an iterative project life cycle for a single product delivery.

Section 3
3.1.3 Characteristics of Incremental Life Cycles
Some projects optimize for speed of delivery. Many businesses and 
initiatives cannot afford to wait for everything to be completed; in these 
cases, customers are willing to receive a subset of the overall solution. This 
frequent delivery of smaller deliverables is called an incremental life cycle 
(see Figure 3-4).

Have you ever been involved on 
a project where the requirements 
seemed to change daily and thought, 
“We will know the requirements 
when we deliver a prototype that the 
business approves.” If so, this was 
a project where agile approaches 
could have helped. A prototype 
encourages feedback and a better 
understanding of the requirements 
that can be incorporated into 
each deliverable.
TIP
Are you unsure of how a new business service might work in practice? Create a proof of concept 
with evaluation criteria to explore desired outcomes. Use iterative approaches when you suspect the 
requirements will change based on customer feedback.

--- SOURCE: AgilePracticeGuide.pdf | PAGE 38 ---
23
Incremental life cycles optimize work for delivering value to sponsors 
or customers more often than a single, final product. Teams plan initial 
deliverables before beginning their work, and they begin working on that 
first delivery as soon as possible. Some agile projects deliver value within 
days of project initiation. Others could take longer, ranging from 1 week to 
several weeks.
As the project continues, the team may deviate from the original vision. 
The team can manage the deviations, because the team delivers value 
sooner. The degree of change and variation is less important than ensuring 
customers get value sooner than at the end of the project.
Providing a customer a single feature or a finished piece of work is an 
example of the incremental approach.
For example, builders may want to show a finished room or floor of a 
building before they continue with the remainder of the building. In that case, 
they may complete a floor with fixtures, paint, and everything else intended 
for the finished floor before proceeding to the next floor. The customer 
is able to see and approve of the style, color, and other details, allowing 
adjustments to be made before further investments of time and money are 
made. This reduces potential rework and/or customer dissatisfaction.
Completeness and delivery are 
subjective. The team may need 
feedback on a prototype and may 
then choose to deliver a minimum 
viable product (MVP) to a subset of 
customers. The customers’ feedback 
helps the team to learn what they 
need to provide for subsequent 
delivery of the final finished feature.
Agile teams, as a key differentiator, 
deliver business value often. As the 
product adds a broader set of features 
and a broader range of consumers, 
we say it is delivered incrementally.

3.1.4 Characteristics of Agile Life Cycles
In an agile environment, the team expects requirements to change. The iterative and incremental approaches provide 
feedback to better plan the next part of the project. However, in agile projects, incremental delivery uncovers hidden 
or misunderstood requirements. Figure 3-5 illustrates two possible ways to achieve incremental delivery so the project 
aligns with customer needs and can be adapted as necessary.

25
In iteration-based agile, the team works in iterations (timeboxes of equal duration) to deliver completed features. 
The team works on the most important feature, collaborating as a team to finish it. Then the team works on the next 
most important feature and finishes it. The team may decide to work on a few features at a time, but the team does 
not address all of the work for the iteration at once (i.e., does not address all of the requirements, followed by all of the 
analyses, etc.).
In flow-based agile, the team pulls features from the backlog based on its capacity to start work rather than on 
an iteration-based schedule. The team defines its workflow with columns on a task board and manages the work in 
progress for each column. Each feature may take a different amount of time to finish. Teams keep work-in-progress 
sizes small to better identify issues early and reduce rework should changes be required. Without iterations to define 
planning and review points, the team and business stakeholders determine the most appropriate schedule for planning, 
product reviews, and retrospectives.
Agile life cycles are those that fulfill the principles of the Agile Manifesto. In particular, customer satisfaction increases 
with early and continuous delivery of valuable products. Moreover, an incremental deliverable that is functional and 
provides value is the primary measure of progress. Agile life cycles combine both iterative and incremental approaches 
in order to adapt to high degrees of change and deliver project value more often.
3.1.5 Agile Suitability Filters
Various assessment models exist to help determine the likely fit or gaps for using agile approaches. These models 
assess project and organizational factors associated with adoption and suitability and then provide scores indicating 
alignment or potential risk areas. Appendix X3 provides a synthesis of popular assessment models for use as an agile 
suitability filter.

Section 3
3.1.6 Characteristics of Hybrid Life Cycles
It is not necessary to use a single approach for an entire project. Projects 
often combine elements of different life cycles in order to achieve certain 
goals. A combination of predictive, iterative, incremental, and/or agile 
approaches is a hybrid approach.
Figure 3-6 depicts the basic, pure approaches to project types that 
combine to form a hybrid model. The early processes utilize an agile 
development life cycle, which is then followed by a predictive rollout phase. 
This approach can be used when there is uncertainty, complexity, and risk 
in the development portion of the project that would benefit from an agile 
approach, followed by a defined, repeatable rollout phase that is appropriate 
to undertake in a predictive way, perhaps by a different team. An example 
of this approach is the development of a new high-tech product followed by 
rollout and training to thousands of users.
Example of a Hybrid Life 
Cycle Project
A pharmaceutical company had 
a time-consuming U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) approval 
process tagged onto the end of its 
development process and its entire 
life cycle looked like Figure 3-6. 
While project teams undertook drug 
trials in an agile fashion, they had 
to present the drugs to an external 
group to perform the FDA approval 
process. A consultant helped to 
integrate the FDA approval process 
portion into the agile development 
process to create a more streamlined 
hybrid approach.
The short version of the story 
is that because FDA approval is 
required to be completed at the 
end of the development process 
or repeated after any change 
(this includes even after the most 
minor change), the process had 
to remain at the end as a separate 
phase. 
Integration 
using 
the 
iterative process was unsuccessful. 
However, the consultant created 
some useful quick-start guides and 
testing protocols that shortened the 
final FDA approval process.

Figure 3-6. Agile Development Followed by a Predictive Rollout
3.1.7 Combined Agile and Predictive Approaches
Another approach is to use a combination of agile and predictive approaches throughout the life cycle.
Figure 3-7. A Combined Agile and Predictive Approach Used Simultaneously
In Figure 3-7, a combination of both predictive and agile approaches are used in the same project. Perhaps the team is 
incrementally transitioning to agile and using some approaches like short iterations, daily standups, and retrospectives, 
but other aspects of the project such as upfront estimation, work assignment, and progress tracking are still following 
predictive approaches.
Using both predictive and agile approaches is a common scenario. It would be misleading to call the approach agile 
since it clearly does not fully embody the agile mindset, values, and principles. However, it would also be inaccurate to 
call it predictive since it is a hybrid approach.

Section 3
3.1.8 Predominantly Predictive Approach with Some Agile Components
Figure 3-8 shows a small agile element within a chiefly predictive project. In this case, a portion of the project with 
uncertainty, complexity, or opportunity for scope creep is being tackled in an agile way, but the remainder of the project 
is being managed using predictive approaches. An example of this approach would be an engineering firm that is 
building a facility with a new component.
Figure 3-8. A Largely Predictive Approach with Agile Components
While the majority of the project may be routine and predictable, like many other facility projects the organization 
has undertaken before, this project incorporates a new roofing material. The contractor may plan for some small-scale 
installation trials on the ground first to determine the best installation method and to uncover issues early while there is 
plenty of time to solve them and incrementally improve processes through experimentation and adaptation.
3.1.9 A Largely Agile Approach with a Predictive Component
Figure 3-9 depicts a largely agile approach with a predictive component. This approach might be used when a 
particular element is non-negotiable or not executable using an agile approach. Examples include integrating an external 
component developed by a different vendor that cannot or will not partner in a collaborative or incremental way. A single 
integration is required after the component is delivered.

3.1.10 Hybrid Life Cycles as Fit-For-Purpose
Project teams may design a hybrid life cycle based on project risks. For 
example, a campus construction project may have multiple buildings to 
improve and build. An incremental approach would focus resources on 
completing some buildings earlier than others, accelerating the return 
on investment. Each individual delivery may be sufficiently well known to 
benefit from a predictive life cycle for that building alone.
The goal of project management is to produce business value in the 
best possible way given the current environment. It does not matter if 
that way is agile or predictive. The question to ask is: “How can we be 
most successful?”
Is feedback needed as the team produces value? If so, increments will 
help. Is it necessary to manage risk as ideas are explored? If so, iterations 
or agile will help.
When the organization cannot deliver intermediate value, agile 
approaches may not be useful. That is okay—agile for the sake of agile is 
not the goal. The point is to select a life cycle or a combination of life cycles 
that work for the project, the risks, and the culture.
Agile is about customer-based delivery on a frequent basis. That delivery 
creates feedback for the team. The team uses that feedback to plan and 
replan the next chunk of work.
A government department had 
a 
credit 
insurance 
application 
development project. The multi-
year project was to replace its aging 
underwriting system with a new, 
more responsive user interface and 
system integrations. The bulk of 
the project was undertaken using 
an agile approach with continual 
business input.
The premium rate calculations 
were handed down from the 
Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) 
as a 200-page specification. The 
steps were very clearly explained 
with little opportunity for confusion 
(or interim result confirmation by 
the business) and were coded up 
by a separate team working its way 
through the calculation steps. The 
two teams collaborated on the input 
variables required for the calculation 
and how to consume and display the 
output values, but beyond that, the 
calculation team worked in a largely 
predictive manner.
When the calculation team’s 
portion was complete, the outputs 
from the premium rate calculations 
were displayed on the screens and in 
the reports. Then the business users 
provided feedback on the appearance 
and use of the information. The two 
teams ran concurrently, but had little 
need for interaction. Having them 
physically close to each other made 
it easier to check in on development 
progress, but largely they were 
separate subprojects.

Section 3
3.1.11 Hybrid Life Cycles as Transition Strategy
Many teams are not able to make the switch to agile ways of working overnight. Agile techniques look and feel 
very different to those who are accustomed to and have been successful in a predictive environment. The larger the 
organization and the more moving parts, the longer it will take to transition. For that reason, it makes sense to plan a 
gradual transition.
A gradual transition involves adding more iterative techniques to improve learning and alignment among teams and 
stakeholders. Later, consider adding more incremental techniques to accelerate value and return on investment to 
sponsors. This combination of various approaches is considered a hybrid approach.
Try these new techniques on a less risky project with a medium- to low-degree of uncertainty. Then, when the 
organization is successful with a hybrid approach, try more complex projects that require more of those techniques to 
be added. This is a way to tailor the progressive hybrid transition to the organization’s situation and specific risks and 
the team’s readiness to adapt and embrace the changes.

3.2 Mixing Agile Approaches
Agile teams rarely limit their practices to one agile approach. Each project 
context has its own peculiarities, such as the varied mix of team member 
skills and backgrounds; the various components of the product under 
development; and the age, scale, criticality, complexity, and regulatory 
constraints of the environment in which the work takes place.
Agile frameworks are not customized for the team. The team may need 
to tailor practices to deliver value on a regular basis. Often, teams practice 
their own special blend of agile, even if they use a particular framework as 
a starting point.
Blending Approaches
As an example of tailoring agile 
frameworks, one of the most 
common blends in widespread 
use involves a coordinated use of 
the Scrum framework, the Kanban 
Method, and elements of the eXtreme 
Programming (XP) method. Scrum 
provides guidance on the use of a 
product backlog, a product owner, 
scrum master, and a cross-functional 
development team, including sprint 
planning, daily scrum, sprint review, 
and sprint retrospective sessions. 
A kanban board helps the team to 
further improve its effectiveness 
by visualizing the flow of work, 
making impediments easily visible, 
and allowing flow to be managed 
by adjusting work in process limits. 
In addition, XP-inspired engineering 
practices such as use of story cards, 
continuous integration, refactoring, 
automated testing, and test-driven 
development further increase the 
effectiveness of the agile team. In 
summary, the blend of practices 
from these various sources produces 
a synergistic result of higher 
performance than each individual 
component in isolation.

3.3 Project Factors That Influence Tailoring
Sometimes project attributes require tailoring an approach for a better fit. Table 3-2 identifies some project factors 
and tailoring options to consider.
Table 3-2. Tailoring Options to Improve Fit
For additional guidance on factors that influence tailoring see Appendix X2 on Attributes that Influence Tailoring.
Project Factor
Tailoring Options
Demand pattern: steady or sporadic
Rate of process improvement required by the level of 
team experience
The flow of work is often interrupted by various delays or 
impediments
The quality of the product increments is poor
More than one team is needed to build a product
The project team members are inexperienced in the use 
of agile approaches
Many teams find that using a cadence (in the form of a 
regular timebox) helps them demo, retrospect, and take 
in new work. In addition, some teams need more 
flexibility in their acceptance of more work. Teams can 
use flow-based agile with a cadence to get the best of 
both worlds.
Retrospect more often and select improvements.
Consider making work visible using kanban boards and 
experimenting with limits for the various areas of the 
work process in order to improve flow.
Consider using the various test-driven development 
practices. This mistake-proofing discipline makes it 
difficult for defects to remain undetected.
To scale from one to several agile teams, with minimal 
disruption, first learn about agile program management 
or formal scaling frameworks. Then, craft an approach 
that fits the project context.
Consider starting by training team members in the 
fundamentals of the agile mindset and principles. If the 
team decides to use a specific approach such as Scrum 
or Kanban, provide a workshop on that approach so the 
team members can learn how to use it.

IMPLEMENTING AGILE:  
CREATING AN AGILE ENVIRONMENT
4.1 Start with an Agile Mindset
Managing a project using an agile approach requires that the project team adopt an agile mindset. The answers to 
the following questions will help to develop an implementation strategy:
u
u How can the project team act in an agile manner?
u
u What can the team deliver quickly and obtain early feedback to benefit the next delivery cycle?
u
u How can the team act in a transparent manner?
u
u What work can be avoided in order to focus on high-priority items?
u
u How can a servant-leadership approach benefit the achievement of the team’s goals?
4.2 Servant Leadership Empowers the Team
Agile approaches emphasize servant leadership as a way to empower teams. Servant leadership is the practice of 
leading through service to the team, by focusing on understanding and addressing the needs and development of team 
members in order to enable the highest possible team performance.
The role of a servant leader is to facilitate the team’s discovery and definition of agile. Servant leaders practice and 
radiate agile. Servant leaders approach project work in this order:
u
u Purpose. Work with the team to define the “why” or purpose so they can engage and coalesce around the goal 
for the project. The entire team optimizes at the project level, not the person level.
u
u People. Once the purpose is established, encourage the team to create an environment where everyone can 
succeed. Ask each team member to contribute across the project work.
u
u Process. Do not plan on following the “perfect” agile process, but instead look for the results. When a cross-
functional team delivers finished value often and reflects on the product and process, the teams are agile. It does 
not matter what the team calls its process.

Section 4
The following characteristics of servant leadership enable project leaders to become more agile and facilitate the 
team’s success:
u
u Promoting self-awareness;
u
u Listening;
u
u Serving those on the team;
u
u Helping people grow;
u
u Coaching vs. controlling;
u
u Promoting safety, respect, and trust; and
u
u Promoting the energy and intelligence of others.
Servant leadership is not unique to agile. But once having practiced it, servant leaders can usually see how well 
servant leadership integrates into the agile mindset and value.
When leaders develop their servant leadership or facilitative skills, they are more likely to become agile. As a result, 
servant leaders can help their teams collaborate to deliver value faster.
Successful agile teams embrace the growth mindset, where people believe they can learn new skills. When the team 
and the servant leaders believe they can all learn, everyone becomes more capable.
4.2.1 Servant Leader Responsibilities
Servant leaders manage relationships to build communication and coordination within the team and across the 
organization. These relationships help the leaders navigate the organization to support the team. This kind of support 
helps to remove impediments and facilitates the team to streamline its processes. Because servant leaders understand 
agile and practice a specific approach to agile, they can assist in fulfilling the team’s needs.

4.2.1.1 Servant Leaders Facilitate
When project managers act as servant leaders, the emphasis shifts from “managing coordination” to “facilitating 
collaboration.” Facilitators help everyone do their best thinking and work. Facilitators encourage the team’s participation, 
understanding, and shared responsibility for the team’s output. Facilitators help the team create acceptable solutions.
Servant leaders promote collaboration and conversation within the team and between teams. For example, a 
servant leader helps to expose and communicate bottlenecks inside and between teams. Then the teams resolve 
those bottlenecks.
Additionally, a facilitator encourages collaboration through interactive meetings, informal dialog, and knowledge 
sharing. Servant leaders do this by becoming impartial bridge-builders and coaches, rather than by making decisions 
for which others should be responsible.
4.2.1.2 Servant Leaders Remove Organizational Impediments
The first value of the Agile Manifesto is individuals and interactions over processes and tools. What better responsibility 
for a servant leader to take on than to take a hard look at processes that are impeding a team’s or organization’s 
agility and work to streamline them? For example, if a department requires extensive documentation, the role of the 
servant leader could be to work with that department to review required documentation, assist with creating a shared 
understanding of how agile deliverables meet those requirements, and evaluate the amount of documentation required 
so teams are spending more time delivering a valuable product instead of producing exhaustive documentation.
Servant leaders should also look at other processes that are lengthy, causing bottlenecks and impeding a team’s or 
organization’s agility. Examples of processes or departments that may need to be addressed include finance, change 
control boards, or audits. Servant leaders can partner and work with others to challenge them to review their processes 
to support agile teams and leaders. For example, what good is it for the team to deliver working product every 2 weeks 
only to have the product fall into a queue or process that could take 6 or more weeks to release due to lengthy release 
processes? Far too many organizations have these “bottleneck” processes that prevent teams from quickly delivering 
valuable products or services. The servant leader has the ability to change or remove these organizational impediments 
to support delivery teams.

Section 4
4.2.1.3 Servant Leaders Pave the Way for Others’ 
Contribution
In agile, the team manages its work process and its work product. That 
self-management and self-organization applies to everyone serving and 
supporting the organization and project. Servant leaders work to fulfill 
the needs of the teams, projects, and organization. Servant leaders may 
work with facilities for a team space, work with management to enable the 
team to focus on one project at a time, or work with the product owner to 
develop stories with the team. Some servant leaders work with auditors to 
refine the processes needed in regulatory environments, and some servant 
leaders work with the finance department to transition the organization to 
incremental budgeting.
The servant leader focuses on paving the way for the team to do its 
best work. The servant leader influences projects and encourages the 
organization to think differently.
4.2.1.4 Consider These Servant Leader Responsibilities
Servant leaders can have many possible titles, but what is most important 
is what they do. Here are some examples of the responsibilities a servant 
leader may have:
Interpersonal skills versus 
technical skills
In addition to servant leadership, 
team members emphasize their 
interpersonal 
and 
emotional 
intelligence 
skills—not 
just 
technical skills. Everyone on the 
team works to exhibit more initiative, 
integrity, emotional intelligence, 
honesty, 
collaboration, 
humility, 
and willingness to communicate in 
various ways so that the entire team 
can work together well.
The team needs these skills so 
they can respond well to changes 
in project direction and technical 
product changes. When everyone 
can adapt to the work and to each 
other, the entire team is more likely 
to succeed.

u
u Educate stakeholders around why and how to be agile. Explain the benefits of business value based on 
prioritization, greater accountability and productivity of empowered teams, and improved quality from more 
frequent reviews, etc.
u
u Support the team through mentoring, encouragement, and support. Advocate for team members training and 
career development. The oxymoronic quote “We lead teams by standing behind them” speaks to the role of the 
leader in developing their team members. Through support, encouragement, and professional development, 
team members gain confidence, take on larger roles, and contribute at higher levels within their organizations. A 
key role of the servant leader is to nurture and grow team members through and beyond their current roles, even 
if that means losing them from the team.
u
u Help the team with technical project management activities like quantitative risk analysis. Sometimes team 
members may not have knowledge or experience in roles or functions. Servant leaders who may have more 
exposure or training in techniques can support the team by providing training or undertaking these activities.
u
u Celebrate team successes and support and bridge building activities with external groups. Create upward spirals 
of appreciation and good will for increased collaboration.
4.2.2 Role of the Project Manager in an Agile Environment
The role of the project manager in an agile project is somewhat of an unknown, because many agile frameworks 
and approaches do not address the role of the project manager. Some agile practitioners think the role of a project 
manager is not needed, due to self-organizing teams taking on the former responsibilities of the project manager. 
However, pragmatic agile practitioners and organizations realize that project managers can add significant value in 
many situations. The key difference is that their roles and responsibilities look somewhat different.
TIP
The value of project managers is not in their position, but in their ability to make everyone else better.

Section 4
4.2.3 Project Managers Use Servant Leadership
The PMBOK® Guide – Sixth Edition, defines the project manager as “the person assigned by the performing 
organization to lead the team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives.”
Many project managers are accustomed to being at the center of coordination for the project, tracking and 
representing the team’s status to the rest of the organization. This approach was fine when projects were decomposed 
into siloed functions.
However, in high-change projects, there is more complexity than one person can manage. Instead, cross-functional 
teams coordinate their own work and collaborate with the business representative (the product owner).
When working on an agile project, project managers shift from being the center to serving the team and the 
management. In an agile environment, project managers are servant leaders, changing their emphasis to coaching 
people who want help, fostering greater collaboration on the team, and aligning stakeholder needs. As a servant leader, 
project managers encourage the distribution of responsibility to the team: to those people who have the knowledge to 
get work done.
4.3 Team Composition
A core tenet in both the values and the principles of the Agile Manifesto is the importance of individuals and 
interactions. Agile optimizes the flow of value, emphasizing rapid feature delivery to the customer, rather than on how 
people are “utilized.”
TIP
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and 
trust them to get the job done.

39
When teams think about how to optimize the flow of value, the following benefits become apparent:
u
u People are more likely to collaborate.
u
u 	Teams finish valuable work faster.
u
u Teams waste much less time because they do not multitask and have to re-establish context.
4.3.1 Agile Teams
Agile teams focus on rapid product development so they can obtain feedback. In practice, the most effective agile 
teams tend to range in size from three to nine members. Ideally, agile teams are colocated in a team space. Team 
members are 100% dedicated to the teams. Agile encourages self-managing teams, where team members decide who 
will perform the work within the next period’s defined scope. Agile teams thrive with servant leadership. The leaders 
support the teams’ approach to their work.
Cross-functional agile teams produce functional product increments frequently. That is because the teams collectively 
own the work and together have all of the necessary skills to deliver completed work.
Regardless of the overall agile approach, the more a team limits its work in progress, the more likely its members 
can collaborate to expedite work across the board. Team members in successful agile teams work to collaborate in 
various ways (such as pairing, swarming, and mobbing) so they do not fall into the trap of mini-waterfalls instead of 
collaborative work. Mini-waterfalls occur when the team addresses all of the requirements in a given period, then 
attempts to do all of the design, then moves on to do all of the building. Using this scenario, at some point in the building 
or the testing following the building, the team may realize it had assumptions that are no longer valid. In this case, the 
team wasted time in addressing all of the requirements. Instead, when team members collaborate to produce a small 
number of features across the board, they learn as they proceed and deliver smaller finished features.
Agile projects benefit from project team structures that improve collaboration within and among the teams. Table 4-1 
shows how collaborative team members boost productivity and facilitate innovative problem solving.

Table 4-2. Agile Team Roles
Role
Description
Cross-functional team member
Product owner
Team facilitator
Cross-functional teams consist of team members with all the skills necessary to 
produce a working product. In software development, cross-functional teams 
are typically comprised of designers, developers, testers, and any other required 
roles. The cross-functional development teams consist of professionals who 
deliver potentially releasable product on a regular cadence. Cross-functional 
teams are critical because they can deliver finished work in the shortest 
possible time, with higher quality, without external dependencies.
The product owner is responsible for guiding the direction of the product. 
Product owners rank the work based on its business value. Product owners work 
with their teams daily by providing product feedback and setting direction on 
the next piece of functionality to be developed/delivered. That means the work 
is small, often small enough to be described on one index card.
The product owner works with stakeholders, customers, and the teams to define 
the product direction. Typically, product owners have a business background 
and bring deep subject matter expertise to the decisions. Sometimes, the 
product owner requests help from people with deep domain expertise, such as 
architects, or deep customer expertise, such as product managers. Product 
owners need training on how to organize and manage the flow of work through 
the team.
In agile, the product owners create the backlog for and with the team. The 
backlog helps the teams see how to deliver the highest value without 
creating waste.
A critical success factor for agile teams is strong product ownership. Without 
attention to the highest value for the customer, the agile team may create 
features that are not appreciated, or otherwise insufficiently valuable, therefore 
wasting effort.
The third role typically seen on agile teams is of a team facilitator, a servant 
leader. This role may be called a project manager, scrum master, project team 
lead, team coach, or team facilitator.
All agile teams need servant leadership on the team. People need time to build 
their servant leadership skills of facilitation, coaching, and impediment removal.
Initially, many organizations invite external agile coaches to help them when 
their internal coaching capability is not yet fully developed. 
External coaches have the advantage of experience, but the disadvantage of 
weak relationships in the client organization. Internal coaches, on the other 
hand, have strong relationships in their organization, but may lack the breadth 
of experience that would make them highly effective.

Section 4
4.3.3 Generalizing Specialists
Agile teams are cross-functional, but the people often do not start off that 
way. However, many successful agile teams are made up of generalizing 
specialists, or “T-shaped” people.
This means team members have both a focus specialty plus a breadth 
of experience across multiple skills, rather than a single specialization. 
Agile team members work to develop such characteristics due to intense 
collaboration and self-organization to swarm and get work done quickly, 
which requires them to routinely help each other.
A single person’s throughput is not relevant. Focusing on a single 
person’s throughput may even be harmful if it creates a bottleneck for the 
rest of the team. The goal is for the team to optimize the delivery of finished 
work to get feedback.
If the customer desires great results, such as rapid feature delivery with 
excellent quality, the team cannot be structured just with specialist roles 
in an attempt to maximize resource efficiency. The team’s objective is flow 
efficiency, optimizing the throughput of the entire team. Small batch sizes 
promote working together as a team. The product owner’s job is to make 
sure the team works on the highest-value work.
“I-shaped people and 
T-shaped people”
Some 
people 
have 
deep 
specializations in one domain, but 
rarely contribute outside of that 
domain. These people are known 
in agile communities as “I-shaped 
people” since, like the letter “I,” 
they have depth, but not much 
breadth. By contrast “T-shaped 
people” supplement their expertise 
in one area with supporting, but 
less-developed skills in associated 
areas and good collaboration skills. 
As an example, a person who can 
test some areas of the product 
and develop different areas of 
the product is considered to be a 
T-shaped person.
A T-shaped person has a 
defined, recognized specialization 
and primary role, but has the 
skills, versatility, and aptitude for 
collaboration to help other people 
when and where necessary. This 
collaboration reduces hand-offs and 
the constraints of only one person 
being able to do the job.

4.3.4 Team Structures
Teams have adopted agile principles and practices across many industries. They organize people into cross-functional 
teams to iteratively develop working products.
Some organizations have been able to create colocated, cross-functional teams; others have a different situation. 
Instead of having all team members colocated, some organizations have distributed or dispersed teams. Distributed 
teams have cross-functional teams in different locations. Dispersed teams may have each team member working in a 
completely different location, either in an office or from home. While these arrangements are not ideal due to increased 
communication costs, they may still be workable.
C A S E
The core team assembled to write this practice guide had varied backgrounds—some 
represented PMI and some represented Agile Alliance. They were self-organizing and worked in 
increments to complete the work. PMI assembled a group of subject matter experts to inspect 
the work, and this allowed the team to incorporate feedback and improve the product as it was 
developed. However the core team was not representative of a typical agile team because its 
members’ time was not 100% dedicated to this endeavor.

Section 4
4.3.5 Dedicated Team Members
What happens when the team members’ time is not 100% dedicated to the team? While this condition is not ideal, 
unfortunately, it sometimes cannot be avoided.
The key problem with having someone invest only a capacity of 25% or 50% on the team is that they will multitask 
and task switch. Multitasking reduces the throughput of the team’s work and impacts the team’s ability to predict 
delivery consistently.
2 A follow-the-sun development process is one where work is handed off at the end of every day from one site to the 
next, many time zones away in order to speed up product development.
In one large, U.S.-based financial institution there was a program with a set of teams where the team members 
were based on the East Coast of the United States and several locations throughout India. When the team first started, 
it was one large dispersed team (UX, analysts, developers, and testers) doing a “follow the sun”2 development practice 
where some working time overlapped across the team members to do warm hand-offs with the work. Team members 
conducted daily standups together and used webcams to include all team members. Key roles (analysts, product owners, 
UX designers, and development leads) in the U.S. would come in early to answer any questions from their India-based 
team members and help to resolve impediments.
As the product started getting larger, and more funding came through, they decided to break into five smaller teams. 
To do this, they decided to build colocated, distributed teams in various locations. They made the decision to build cross-
functional, colocated teams in each of these locations consisting of developers and testers.
They also had a core set of analysts, based in the two U.S. locations, who worked with their U.S.-based product 
manager and product owners and then worked with each of the teams, respectively. Although they had some structure 
in place where they conducted product reviews as an entire program, most of the other activities were conducted at a 
team level, based on what worked best for each team, to allow them to self-organize.
TIP
Multitasking slows the progress of the entire team, because team members waste time context 
switching and/or waiting for each other to finish other work. When people are 100% dedicated to the 
team, the team has the fastest possible throughput.

People experience productivity losses somewhere between 20% and 40% when task switching. The loss increases 
exponentially with the number of tasks.
When a person multitasks between two projects, that person is not 50% on each project. Instead, due to the cost of 
task switching, the person is somewhere between 20% and 40% on each project.
People are more likely to make mistakes when they multitask. Task-switching consumes working memory and 
people are less likely to remember their context when they multitask.
When everyone on the team is 100% allocated to one project, they can continuously collaborate as a team, making 
everyone’s work more effective.
See Table A1-2 on Project Management Process Group and Knowledge Area Mapping for more tips on teams in agile 
environments, specifically the processes in the Project Resource Management Knowledge Area.
TIP
Not all teams have all the roles that they need. For example, some teams need support from database 
administrators or research analysts. When a team has temporarily assigned specialists, it is important 
to ensure that everyone has the same set of expectations. Is this specialist 100% allocated to the team 
and for how long? Set expectations with everyone (the specialist and the team) to clarify the level of 
commitment so the team can deliver. Part-time assignments create risks for the project.
C A S E
Since core team members developing this practice guide cannot dedicate 100% of their 
capacity to the team’s efforts, their throughput is substantially lower than what it might be 
if they could afford to collocate and invest their attention full-time to the project. However, 
while it is economically viable to collaborate, even if dispersed and operating at a fraction of 
their full capacity, it is not feasible to colocate and focus at full capacity. Therefore, the team 
identified their dispersion as a potential risk. The team tracks and monitors the progress of 
their work through the use of collaborative tools and adjusts assignments based on individual 
capacity accordingly.

4.3.6 Team Workspaces
Teams need a space in which they can work together, to understand their state as a team, and to collaborate. Some 
agile teams all work in one room together. Some teams have a team workspace for their standups and charts, and work 
on their own in cubicles or offices.
While companies are moving toward open, collaborative work environments, organizations also need to create quiet 
spaces for workers who need uninterrupted time to think and work. Therefore, companies are designing their offices 
to balance common and social areas with quiet areas or private spaces where individuals can work without being 
interrupted (sometimes called “caves and common”).
When teams have geographically distributed members, the team decides how much of their workplace is virtual and 
how much is physical. Technology such as document sharing, video conferencing, and other virtual collaboration tools 
help people collaborate remotely.
Geographically distributed teams need virtual workspaces. In addition, consider getting the team together in person 
at regular intervals so the team can build trust and learn how to work together.
Some techniques to consider for managing communication in dispersed teams are fishbowl windows and 
remote pairing:
u
u Create a fishbowl window by setting up long-lived video conferencing links between the various locations in 
which the team is dispersed. People start the link at the beginning of a workday, and close it at the end. In 
this way, people can see and engage spontaneously with each other, reducing the collaboration lag otherwise 
inherent in the geographical separation.
u
u Set up remote pairing by using virtual conferencing tools to share screens, including voice and video links. As 
long as the time zone differences are accounted for, this may prove almost as effective as face-to-face pairing.
TIP
Form teams by bringing people with different skills from different functions together. Educate managers 
and leaders about the agile mindset and engage them early in the agile transformation.

4.3.7 Overcoming Organizational Silos
The best place to start when forming agile teams is by building a foundational trust and a safe work environment to 
ensure that all team members have an equal voice and can be heard and considered. This, along with building the agile 
mindset is the underlying success factor—all other challenges and risks can be mitigated.
Often, siloed organizations create impediments for forming cross-functional agile teams. The team members 
needed to build the cross-functional teams typically report to different managers and have different metrics by which 
managers measure their performance. Managers need to focus on flow efficiency (and team-based metrics) rather 
than resource efficiency.
To overcome organizational silos, work with the various managers of these team members and have them dedicate the 
necessary individuals to the cross-functional team. This not only creates team synergy but also allows the organization 
to see how leveraging its people will optimize the project or product being built.
For more information about teams see Appendix X2 on Attributes that Influence Tailoring.
TIP
As an agile project leader, first focus on how you can create a team that is cross-functional and 100% 
dedicated to one team. Even if it means just getting key team members, such as the developers and testers, 
to work and communicate together on a daily basis, that is a step in the right direction toward agility.

IMPLEMENTING AGILE:  
DELIVERING IN AN AGILE ENVIRONMENT
5.1 Charter the Project and the Team
Every project needs a project charter so the project team knows why this project matters, where the team is headed 
and what the project objective is. However, the project charter itself may not be enough for the team. Agile teams 
require team norms and an understanding of how to work together. In that case, the team might need a team charter.
The chartering process helps the team learn how to work together and coalesce around the project.
At a minimum, for an agile project, the team needs the project vision or purpose and a clear set of working agreements. 
An agile project charter answers these questions:
u
u Why are we doing this project? This is the project vision.
u
u Who benefits and how? This may be part of the project vision and/or project purpose.
u
u What does done mean for the project? These are the project’s release criteria.
u
u How are we going to work together? This explains the intended flow of work.
A servant leader may facilitate the chartering process. A team can coalesce by working together, and the project 
charter is a great way to start working. In addition, team members may want to collaborate to understand how they will 
work together.

50	
Section 5
Teams do not need a formal process for chartering as long as the teams understand how to work together. Some 
teams benefit from a team chartering process. Here are some chartering ideas for team members to use as a basis for 
their social contract:
u
u Team values, such as sustainable pace and core hours;
u
u Working agreements, such as what “ready” means so the team can take in work; what “done” means so the 
team can judge completeness consistently; respecting the timebox; or the use of work-in-process limits;
u
u Ground rules, such as one person talking in a meeting; and
u
u Group norms, such as how the team treats meeting times.
The servant leader together with the team may decide to address other behaviors.
Remember that the team’s social contract—its team charter—is how the team members interact with each other. 
The goal of the team charter is to create an agile environment in which team members can work to the best of their 
ability as a team.
5.2 Common Agile Practices
Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.8 describe a few of the most common agile project practices.
5.2.1 Retrospectives
The single most important practice is the retrospective because it allows the team to learn about, improve, and adapt 
its process.
Retrospectives help the team learn from its previous work on the product and its process. One of the principles 
behind the Agile Manifesto is: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and 
adjusts its behavior accordingly.”

--- SOURCE: AgilePracticeGuide.pdf | PAGE 66 ---
51
Many teams use iterations—especially 2-week iterations—because the iteration prompts a demonstration and a 
retrospective at the end. However, the team does not need iterations in order to retrospect. Team members may decide 
to retrospect at these key times:
u
u When the team completes a release or ships something. It does not have to be a monumental increment. It can 
be any release, no matter how small.
u
u When more than a few weeks have passed since the previous retrospective.
u
u When the team appears to be stuck and completed work is not flowing through the team.
u
u When the team reaches any other milestone.
Teams benefit from allocating enough time to learn, either from an interim retrospective or an end-of-the-project 
retrospective. Teams need to learn about their work product and work process. For example, some teams have trouble 
finishing work. When teams plan enough time, they can structure their retrospective to gather data, process that data, 
and decide what to try later as an experiment.
First and foremost, a retrospective is not about blame; the retrospective is a time for the team to learn from previous 
work and make small improvements. 
The retrospective is about looking at the qualitative (people’s feelings) and quantitative (measurements) data, then 
using that data to find root causes, designing countermeasures, and developing action plans. The project team may end 
up with many action items to remove impediments.
Consider limiting the number of action items to the team’s capacity to address improvement in the upcoming iteration 
or work period. Trying to improve too many things at once and not finishing any of them is much worse than planning to 
complete fewer items and successfully completing all of them. Then, when time allows, the team can work on the next 
improvement opportunity on the list. When the team selects the improvements, decide how to measure the outcomes. 
Then, in the next time period, measure the outcomes to validate success or failure of each improvement.
A facilitator from the team leads them through an activity to rank the importance of each improvement item. Once the 
improvement items are ranked by the team, the team chooses the appropriate number to work on for the next iteration 
(or adds work to the flow if flow-based).

Section 5
5.2.2 Backlog Preparation
The backlog is the ordered list of all the work, presented in story form, for a team. There is no need to create all of the 
stories for the entire project before the work starts—only enough to understand the first release in broad brushstrokes 
and then sufficient items for the next iteration.
Product owners (or a product owner value team that includes the product manager and all relevant product owners 
for that area of the product,) might produce a product roadmap to show the anticipated sequence of deliverables over 
time. The product owner replans the roadmap based on what the team produces. (See Appendix X3 on Agile Suitability 
Filter Tools for examples of roadmaps.)
5.2.3 Backlog Refinement
In iteration-based agile, the product owner often works with the team to prepare some stories for the upcoming 
iteration during one or more sessions in the middle of the iteration. The purpose of these meetings is to refine enough 
stories so the team understands what the stories are and how large the stories are in relation to each other.
There is no consensus on how long the refinement should be. There is a continuum of:
u
u Just-in-time refinement for flow-based agile. The team takes the next card off the to-do column and discusses it.
u
u Many iteration-based agile teams use a timeboxed 1-hour discussion midway through a 2-week iteration. (The 
team selects an iteration duration that provides them frequent-enough feedback.)
u
u Multiple refinement discussions for iteration-based agile teams. Teams can use this when they are new to the 
product, the product area, or the problem domain.
TIP
Consider using impact mapping to see how the product fits together. Under normal circumstances, 
the product owner leads this work. A servant leader can facilitate any necessary meetings as a way of 
serving the project.

--- SOURCE: AgilePracticeGuide.pdf | PAGE 68 ---
53
Refinement meetings allow the product owner to present story ideas to the team and for the team to learn about the 
potential challenges or problems in the stories. If the product owner is unsure of the dependencies, the product owner 
can request the team to spike the feature in order to understand the risks.
There are many ways for the product owner to conduct backlog preparation and refinement meetings, including 
for example:
u
u Encourage the team to work as triads of developer, tester, business analyst/product owner to discuss and write 
the story.
u
u Present the overall story concept to the team. The team discusses and refines it into as many stories as required.
u
u Work with the team to find various ways to explore and write the stories together, making sure all of the stories 
are small enough so the team can produce a steady flow of completed work. Consider becoming able to complete 
a story at least once a day.
Teams often have a goal of spending not more than 1 hour per week refining stories for the next batch of work. 
Teams want to maximize the time spent doing work as opposed to planning work. If the team needs to spend more than 
1 hour per week refining stories, the product owner could be overpreparing, or the team may be lacking some critical 
skills needed to evaluate and refine the work.
5.2.4 Daily Standups
Teams use standups to microcommit to each other, uncover problems, and ensure the work flows smoothly through 
the team.
Timebox the standup to no longer than 15 minutes. The team “walks” the Kanban or task board in some way, and 
anyone from the team can facilitate the standup.
In iteration-based agile, everyone answers the following questions in a round-robin fashion:
u
u What did I complete since the last standup?
u
u What am I planning to complete between now and the next standup?
u
u What are my impediments (or risks or problems)?

--- SOURCE: AgilePracticeGuide.pdf | PAGE 69 ---
54	
Section 5
Questions like these generate answers that allow the team to self-organize and hold each other accountable for 
completing the work they committed to the day before and throughout the iteration.
Flow-based agile has a different approach to standups, focusing on the team’s throughput. The team assesses the 
board from right to left. The questions are:
u
u What do we need to do to advance this piece of work?
u
u Is anyone working on anything that is not on the board?
u
u What do we need to finish as a team?
u
u Are there any bottlenecks or blockers to the flow of work?
One of the antipatterns typically seen in standups is they become status meetings. Teams who have traditionally 
worked in a predictive environment may tend to fall into this antipattern since they are used to providing a status.
Another antipattern typically seen in standups is that the team begins to solve problems as they become apparent. 
Standups are for realizing there are problems—not for solving them. Add the issues to a parking lot, and then create 
another meeting, which might be right after the standup, and solve problems there.
Teams run their own standups. When run well, standups can be very useful, provided the nature of the team’s 
work requires intense collaboration. Make a conscious decision about when the team needs, or can effectively 
use, standups.
TIP
Encourage any team member to facilitate the standup instead of a project manager or leader to ensure 
it does not turn into a status meeting, but instead is used as a time for the team to self-organize and make 
commitments to each other.

55
5.2.5 Demonstrations/Reviews
As the team completes the features usually in the form of user stories, the team periodically demonstrates the 
working product. The product owner sees the demonstration and accepts or declines stories.
In iteration-based agile, the team demonstrates all completed work items at the end of the iteration. In flow-
based agile, the team demonstrates completed work when it is time to do so, usually when enough features have 
accumulated into a set that is coherent. Teams, including the product owner, need feedback to decide how early to 
ask for product feedback.
As a general guideline, demonstrate whatever the team has as a working product at least once every 2 weeks. That 
frequency is enough for most teams, so team members can get feedback that prevents them from heading in a wrong 
direction. That is also frequent enough so that the teams can keep the product development clean enough to build a 
complete product as often as they want or need to.
A fundamental part of what makes a project agile is the frequent delivery of a working product. A team that does 
not demonstrate or release cannot learn fast enough and is likely not adopting agile techniques. The team may require 
additional coaching to enable frequent delivery.
5.2.6 Planning for Iteration-Based Agile
Each team’s capacity is different. Each product owner’s typical story size is different. Teams consider their story size 
so they do not try to commit to more stories than there is team capacity to complete within one iteration.
When people are unavailable (e.g., holidays, vacations, or anything that prevents people from participating in the next 
set of work), the product owner understands that the team has reduced capacity. The team will not be able to finish the 
same amount of work as it finished in the previous time period. When teams have a reduced capacity, they will only 
plan for work that meets that capacity.
Teams estimate what they can complete, which is a measure of capacity (see Section 5.4.1 for examples). Teams 
cannot predict with 100% certainty what they can deliver, as they cannot know the unexpected. When product owners 
make the stories smaller and teams see progress in the form of a finished product, teams learn what they are able to 
do for the future.
Agile teams do not plan just once in one single chunk. Instead, agile teams plan a little, deliver, learn, and then replan 
a little more in an ongoing cycle.
TIP
Draw the team’s attention to the antipattern and help the team to discover how to improve its standups.

5.2.7 Execution Practices that Help Teams Deliver Value
If the team does not pay attention to quality, it will soon become impossible to release anything rapidly.
The following technical practices, many of which come from eXtreme Programming, may help the team to deliver at 
their maximum speed:
u
u Continuous integration. Perform frequent incorporation of work into the whole, no matter the product, and then 
retest to determine that the entire product still works as intended.
u
u Test at all levels. Employ system-level testing for end-to-end information and unit testing for the building 
blocks. In between, understand if there is a need for integration testing and where. Teams find smoke testing 
helpful as a first look at whether the work product is any good. Teams have found that deciding when to run 
regression tests and which ones helps them maintain product quality with good build performance. Agile teams 
have a strong preference for automated tests so they can build and maintain a momentum of delivery.
u
u Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD). In ATDD, the entire team gets together and discusses the 
acceptance criteria for a work product. Then the team creates the tests, which allows the team to write just 
enough code and automated tests to meet the criteria. For non-software projects, consider how to test the work 
as the team completes chunks of value.
u
u Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Writing automated tests before 
writing/creating the product actually helps people design and mistake-proof the product. For non-software 
projects, consider how to “test-drive” the team’s designs. Hardware and mechanical projects often use 
simulations for interim tests of their designs.
u
u Spikes (timeboxed research or experiments). Spikes are useful for learning and may be used in circumstances 
such as: estimation, acceptance criteria definition, and understanding the flow of a user’s action through the 
product. Spikes are helpful when the team needs to learn some critical technical or functional element.

57
5.2.8 How Iterations and Increments Help Deliver Working Product
Iterations help a team create a cadence for delivery and many kinds of feedback. Teams produce increments of 
value for delivery and feedback. The first part of this delivery is a demonstration. Teams receive feedback about how 
the product looks and operates through a demo. Team members retrospect to see how they can inspect and adapt their 
process to succeed.
Demonstrations or reviews are a necessary part of the agile project flow. Schedule the demonstration as appropriate 
for the team’s delivery cadence.
5.3 Troubleshooting Agile Project Challenges
Agile approaches were born out of the need to solve issues associated with high rates of change, uncertainty, and 
complexity on projects. Due to these origins, they contain a variety of tools and techniques for dealing with issues that 
present problems in predictive approaches. Refer to Table 5-1.
TIP
Teams should demo often for feedback and to show progress. Encourage the PMO and other interested 
parties to watch demonstrations so the people deciding on the project portfolio can see the actual progress.

Troubleshooting Possibilities
Unclear purpose or mission for the team
Unclear working agreements for the team
Unclear team context
Unclear requirements
Poor user experience
Inaccurate estimation
Unclear work assignments or work progress
Team struggles with obstacles
Work delays/overruns due to insufﬁciently

Technical debt (degraded code quality)
Agile chartering for purpose—vision, mission, and mission tests
Agile chartering for alignment—values, principles, and working 
agreements
Agile chartering for context—boundaries, committed assets, 
and prospective analysis
Help sponsors and stakeholders craft a product vision. Consider 
building a product roadmap using speciﬁcation by example, user 
story mapping, and impact mapping. Bring the team and product 
owner together to clarify the expectations and value of a 
requirement. Progressively decompose roadmap into backlog of 
smaller, concrete requirements.
User experience design practices included in the development 
team involve users early and often.
Reduce story size by splitting stories. Use relative estimation with 
the entire team to estimate. Consider agile modeling or spiking 
to understand what the story is.
Help the team learn that they self-manage their work. Consider 
kanban boards to see the ﬂow of work. Consider a daily standup 
to walk the board and see what work is where.
A servant leader can help clear these obstacles. If the team 
doesn’t know the options they have, consider a coach. 
Sometimes, the team needs to escalate obstacles (or roadblocks) 
the team or servant leader has not been able to remove.
Product owner and team workshop stories together. Create 
a deﬁnition of ready for the stories. Consider splitting stories 
to use smaller stories. 
Consider the technical practices that work for the environment. 
Some possibilities are: pair work, collective product ownership, 
pervasive testing (test-driven and automated testing 
approaches) and a robust deﬁnition of done.
Team deﬁnes deﬁnition of done for stories including acceptance 
criteria. Also add release criteria for projects.
Refactoring, agile modeling, pervasive testing, automated code

Table 5-1. Agile Pain Points and Troubleshooting Possibilities (cont.)
Pain Point
Troubleshooting Possibilities
Too much product complexity
Slow or no improvement in the 
teamwork process
Too much upfront work leading to rework
False starts, wasted efforts
Inefﬁciently ordered product backlog items
Rush/wait uneven ﬂow of work
Impossible stakeholder demands
Unexpected or unforeseen delays
Siloed teams, instead of cross-functional 
teams
For software and non-software encourage the team always to be 
thinking “What is the simplest thing that would work?” and apply 
the agile principle of “Simplicity--the art of maximizing the 
amount of work not done”. These help reduce complexity.
Capture no more than three items to improve at each 
retrospective. Ask the servant leader to help the team learn 
how to integrate those items. 
Instead of much upfront work, consider team spikes to learn. 
In addition, measure the WIP during the beginning of the project 
and see what the team’s options are to deliver value instead 
of designs. Shorten iterations and create a robust deﬁnition 
of done.
Ask the product owner to become an integral part of the team.
Rank with value including cost of delay divided by duration 
(CD3) and other value models
Plan to the team’s capacity and not more. Ask people to stop 
multitasking and be dedicated to one team. Ask the team 
to work as pairs, a swarm, or mob to even out the capabilities 
across the entire team.
Servant leadership to work with this stakeholder (and possibly 
product owner).
Ask the team to check in more often, use kanban boards to see 
the ﬂow of work and work in progress limits to understand the 
impact of the demands on the team or product. Also track 
impediments and impediment removal on an impediment board.
Ask the people who are part of projects to self-organize as 
cross-functional teams. Use servant leadership skills to help the 
managers understand why agile needs cross-functional teams.

Section 5
5.4 Measurements in Agile Projects
Transitioning to agile means using different measurements. Using agile means looking at new metrics that matter to 
the team and to management. These metrics matter because they focus on customer value.
One problem with status reporting is the team’s ability to predict completion or to use traffic light status to describe 
the project. For instance, project leaders describe the project as “90% done.” At that point the team tries to integrate the 
pieces into a product. The team discovers missing requirements or surprises, or finds that the product doesn’t integrate 
the way they thought it would.
The project is only partway done, and the traffic light status reporting does not reflect the real state. Too often, the 
project team realizes it will need just as much time to complete the remainder of the project. For too many projects, the 
team realizes they are—at most—10% done because of issues the team discovered.
The problem with predictive measurements is that they often do not reflect reality. It often happens that a project 
status light is green up until 1 month before the release date; this is sometimes referred to as a watermelon project 
(green on the outside, red on the inside). Oftentimes project status lights turn red with seemingly no warnings, because 
there is no empirical data about the project until 1 month before the release date.
Metrics for agile projects contain meaningful information that provide a historical track record, because agile 
projects deliver value (finished work) on a regular basis. Project teams can use such data for improved forecasts and 
decision making.
Surrogate measurements such as percent done are less useful than empirical measurements such as finished 
features. Agile helps teams see problems and issues so the team can diagnose and address them.
In addition to quantitative measures, the team can consider collecting qualitative measures. Some of these qualitative 
measures focus on practices the team has chosen and assess how well the team uses those practices, for example, 
the business satisfaction with delivered features, the morale of the team; and anything else the team wants to track as 
a qualitative measure.

5.4.1 Agile Teams Measure Results
Agile favors empirical and value-based measurements instead of 
predictive measurements. Agile measures what the team delivers, not what 
the team predicts it will deliver.
A team that is accustomed to having project baselines and estimates of 
earned value and ROI might be puzzled about working on a project and not 
managing to a baseline. Agile is based on working products of demonstrable 
value to customers.
Baselines are often an artifact of attempted prediction. In agile, the team 
limits its estimation to the next few weeks at most. In agile, if there is low 
variability in the team’s work and if the team members are not multitasking, 
the team’s capacity can become stable. This allows better prediction for the 
next couple of weeks.
After the team completes work in iteration or flow, the team can replan. 
Agile does not create the ability to do more work. However, there is evidence 
that the smaller the chunk of work, the more likely people are to deliver it.
Software product development, like other knowledge work, is about 
learning—learning while delivering value. Hardware development and 
mechanical development are similar in the design parts of the project. 
Learning takes place by experimenting, delivering small increments of 
value, and getting feedback on what has been accomplished thus far. Many 
other product development projects incorporate learning also.
Sponsors usually want to know 
when the project will be done. Once 
the team establishes a reliable 
velocity (average stories or story 
points per iteration) or the average 
cycle time, the team can predict how 
much longer the project will take.
As an example, if the team 
averages 50 story points per 
iteration, and the team estimates 
there are about another 500 points 
remaining, the team estimates it has 
about 10 iterations remaining. As 
the product owner refines the stories 
remaining and as the team refines 
its estimates, the project estimate 
could go up or down, but the team 
can provide an estimate.
If the team averages a cycle time 
of three days per story and there are 
30 remaining stories, the team would 
have 90 business days remaining, 
approximately 4 to 5 months.
Reflect the estimate variability 
with hurricane-style charts, or some 
other variability measure that the 
sponsors will understand.

Section 5
Because learning is such a large part of the project, the team needs to balance uncertainty and provide value to the 
customers. The team plans the next small part of the project. The team reports empirical data and replans further small 
increments to manage the project uncertainty.
Some iteration-based projects use burndown charts to see where the project is going over time. Figure 5-1 shows an 
example of a burndown chart where the team planned to deliver 37 story points. Story points rate the relative work, risk, 
and complexity of a requirement or story. Many agile teams use story points to estimate effort. The dotted burndown 
line is the plan. In Figure 5-1, the team can see by Day 3 that they are at risk for that delivery.

Some project teams prefer burnup charts. The same data used in Figure 5-1 is shown in Figure 5-2 in a burnup chart.
Figure 5-2. Burnup Chart for Showing Story Points Completed
Burnup charts show the work completed. The two charts in Figures 5-1 and 5-2 are based on the same data, but 
displayed in two different ways. Teams may prefer how to see their data.
When a team sees what it has not yet completed as it works through an iteration, the team may become dispirited and 
possibly rush to complete the work without meeting the acceptance criteria. However, the team could have any number 
of good reasons for not completing work as it expected. Burndowns show the effect of team members multitasking, 
stories that are too large, or team members out of the office.

Section 5
Especially with teams new to agile, the burnup will show changes in scope during the iteration. Burnups allow teams 
to see what they have accomplished, which helps the team proceed to the next piece of work.
Whether teams use burndown or burnup charts, they see what they have completed as the iteration progresses. At 
the end of the iteration, they might base their next measure of capacity (how many stories or story points) on what they 
completed in this iteration. That allows the product owner along with the team to replan what the team is more likely to 
succeed in delivering in the next iteration.
Velocity, the sum of the story point sizes for the features actually completed in this iteration, allows the team to plan 
its next capacity more accurately by looking at its historical performance.
Flow-based agile teams use different measurements: lead time (the total time it takes to deliver an item, measured 
from the time it is added to the board to the moment it is completed), cycle time (the time required to process an item), 
and response time (the time that an item waits until work starts). Teams measure cycle time to see bottlenecks and 
delays, not necessarily inside the team.
TIP
Teams might discover it can take four to eight iterations to achieve a stable velocity. The teams need 
the feedback from each iteration to learn about how they work and how to improve.

Section 5
Lead time is useful to understand cycle time from the first look at a particular feature to the length of time it took to 
release it to the customer. The work in progress (WIP) limits at the top of each column, shown in boxes here, allows the 
team to see how to pull work across the board. When the team has met its WIP limits, the team cannot pull work from 
the left into the next column. Instead, the team works from the right-most full column and asks, “What do we do as a 
team to move this work into the next column?”
Each feature is unique, so its cycle time is unique. However, a product owner might notice that smaller features 
have smaller cycle times. The product owner wants to see throughput, so the product owner creates smaller features 
or works with the team to do so.
Burnups, burndowns (capacity measures) and lead time, and cycle time (predictability measures) are useful for in-
the-moment measurements. They help a team understand how much more work they have and whether the team might 
finish on time.
Measuring story points is not the same as measuring completed stories or features. Some teams attempt to measure 
story points without completing the actual feature or story. When teams measure only story points, they measure 
capacity, not finished work, which violates the principle of “the primary measure of progress is working software” (or, 
other product if not software).
Each team has its own capacity. When a team uses story points, be aware that the number of story points a team can 
complete in a given time is unique to that team.
TIP
When teams depend on external people or groups, measure cycle time to see how long it takes for the 
team to complete the work. Measure lead time to see the external dependencies after the team completes 
its work. Teams can also measure the reaction time, the time from ready to the first column, to see how 
long it takes them—on average—to respond to new requests.

When teams provide their own units of measure, teams are better able to assess and estimate and deliver their work. 
The downside of relative estimation is that there is no way to compare teams or add velocity across teams.
The team can measure completed work in a feature burnup/burndown chart and in a product backlog burnup chart. 
These charts provide trends of completion over time, as shown in Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-4. Feature Chart
Feature burnup/burndown charts may show that requirements grew during the project. The features complete line 
shows that the team completes features at a regular pace. The total features line shows how the project’s total features 
changed over time. The features remaining burndown line shows that the rate of feature completion varies. Every time 
features are added to the project, the burndown line changes.
Earned value in agile is based on finished features, as shown in Figure 5-5. The product backlog burnup chart shows 
completed work compared to total expected work at interval milestones or iterations.

Section 5
Figure 5-5. Product Backlog Burnup Chart
A team can only finish one story at a time. To complete a large feature that contains several stories, the team will 
have remaining stories to complete and may not complete that entire feature until several more time periods have 
passed. The team can show its completed value with a product backlog burnup chart as shown in Figure 5-5.
If a team needs to measure earned value, it can consider using this burnup chart in Figure 5-6 as an example: Note 
that the left Y axis represents story points as scope, and the right Y axis represents the project spend.

Figure 5-6. Earned Value in an Agile Context
Traditional EVM metrics like schedule performance index (SPI) and cost performance index (CPI) can be easily 
translated into agile terms. For example, if the team planned to complete 30 story points in an iteration, but only 
completed 25 then the SPI is 25/30 or 0.83 (the team is working at only 83% of the rate planned). Likewise, CPI is 
the earned value (completed features value) to date divided by the actual costs to date or, as shown in Figure 5-6, 
$2.2M / $2.8M = 0.79. This means a result of only 79 cents on the dollar compared to plan (but of course this 
assumes that the prediction is still correct.)

Section 5
A cumulative flow diagram, illustrated in Figure 5-7, shows the work in progress across a board. If a team has many 
stories waiting for test, the testing band will swell. Work accumulation can be seen at a glance.
Teams have trouble with accumulating work: the team has work in progress instead of work completed. When teams 
have a lot of work in progress, they delay their overall feature delivery. The longer it takes for a team to deliver, the more 
pressure a team will have for yet more features in the same period of time.

ORGANIZATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
FOR PROJECT AGILITY
Every project exists in an organizational context. Cultures, structures, 
and policies can influence both the direction and the outcome of any 
project. These dynamics can challenge project leaders.
While project leaders may not have the ability to change 
organizational dynamics as they see fit, they are expected to navigate 
those dynamics skillfully.
This section explores the way the organization and in some circumstances, 
the project context, influences projects. Leaders can explore options for 
change, to increase project success.
6.1 Organizational Change Management
Organizational change management covers the skills and techniques for 
influencing changes that support agility.
The PMI publication, Managing Change in Organizations: A Practice 
Guide [2], describes a comprehensive and holistic approach for successfully 
introducing meaningful change. The recommendations offered there include:
u
u Models for describing change dynamics,
u
u Framework for achieving change, and
u
u Application of change management practices at the project, 
program, and portfolio levels.
Sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 explore the considerations of change 
management specific to an agile context. 
Figure 6-1 shows the relationship between these two topics.
Project agility is more effective 
and sustained as the organization 
adjusts to support it.

6.1.1 Drivers for Change Management
All projects are about change. However, there are two key factors that further motivate the use of change management 
practices in an agile context:
u
u Changes associated with accelerated delivery. Agile approaches emphasize delivering project outputs 
early and often. However, the receiving organization may not be fully prepared to incorporate those outputs 
at an increased pace. Accelerating delivery will test the organization’s ability to accommodate that delivery. 
Successfully discovering and delivering a project’s features is not enough. If the organization resists the project’s 
output, then the targeted return on investment is delayed. Customer acceptance of and alignment with project 
outputs becomes even more prevalent in an agile environment.
u
u Changes associated with agile approaches. Organizations just beginning to use agile approaches also 
experience high degrees of change. Higher degrees of collaboration may require more frequent handoffs 
between teams, departments, or vendors. Decomposing work into iterative prototypes involves rework that 
could be viewed negatively. Leaders should consider change management techniques to address the hurdles of 
transitioning to the use of agile approaches.
6.1.2 Readiness for Change
Organizations beginning to use agile approaches should understand the relative compatibility of those methods 
with their current approaches. Some organizations will have characteristics that more easily support agile principles 
of cross-department collaboration, continuous learning, and evolving internal processes. Examples of these change-
friendly characteristics include:
u
u Executive management’s willingness to change;
u
u Organization’s willingness to shift the way it views, reviews, and assesses employees;
u
u Centralization or decentralization of project, program, and portfolio management functions;
u
u Focus on short-term budgeting and metrics versus long-term goals; and
u
u Talent management maturity and capabilities.

74	
Section 6 
Conversely, there are other institutional characteristics that may be roadblocks to achieving the changes associated 
with organizational agility. Examples of these include:
u
u Work is decomposed into departmental silos, creating dependencies that prevent accelerated delivery instead of 
building cross-functional teams with guidance from centers of competencies.
u
u Procurement strategies are based on short-term pricing strategies, rather than long-term competencies.
u
u Leaders are rewarded for local efficiencies rather than end-to-end flow of project delivery or optimizing the whole 
(in regard to the organization).
u
u Employees are specialized contributors with limited tools or incentives to diversify their skills instead of building 
T-shaped specialists.
u
u Decentralized portfolios pull employees simultaneously onto too many projects at once instead of keeping them 
focused on one project at a time.
The degree to which an organization is willing to review and modify these practices will determine how quickly 
and effectively agile approaches can be adopted. However, in response to these organizational impediments to agility, 
project leaders can try various approaches to accelerate a cultural compatibility for:
u
u Visible and active executive sponsorship,
u
u Change management practices, including communication and coaching,
u
u Progressively pacing the adoption of agile practices on a project-by-project basis
u
u Incremental introduction of agile practices to the team; and
u
u Leading by example by using agile techniques and practices where possible.

6.2 Organizational Culture
An organization’s culture is its DNA—its core identity. Culture will always 
influence the use of agile approaches. Organizational culture runs along a 
continuum, from highly predictive plans to lean startup where everything is an 
experiment. Although agile approaches fit well with the lean startup culture, a 
highly predictive organization can encourage empirical measurements, small 
experiments, and learning so they can move toward agility.
6.2.1 Creating an Environment of Safety
Organizational culture is difficult to change, but the most important 
cultural norm in an organization willing to try any new method or technique 
is enabling a safe work environment.
Only in a safe, honest, and transparent environment can team members 
and leaders truly reflect on their successes to ensure their projects continue 
to advance, or apply lessons learned on failed projects so they do not fall 
back into the same patterns.
6.2.2 Assessing Culture
Every project finds itself in tension with competing aspirations. How can 
the team go fast without compromising quality? How can the team preserve 
flexibility while also hitting a firm date? Most importantly, how does the 
team satisfy and meet the requirements of the customer?
Project leaders may feel their job is to meet every expectation of every 
stakeholder; but, when compelled to make a choice, there is often a priority 
depending on the culture and requirements of the organization’s business 
environment. For example, a mobile telecom project has a greater bias 
for speed, where a government program may have a greater bias for 
generalization and stability.
“Culture 
eats 
strategy 
for 
breakfast” —Peter Drucker
This statement stresses the 
importance of people’s commitment 
and passion for a cause. No matter 
what strategy or plan you implement 
with your team, its success is 
going to be governed by the people 
implementing the plan. If the people 
who are driving the strategy aren’t 
passionate about the change, or 
worse, are apathetic about their 
job and their organization, then you 
stand little chance of implementing 
the change.

Section 6 
To navigate these dynamics, project leaders should take the time to assess where emphasis is most often applied 
in the organization. Figure 6-2 illustrates what an assessment might look like. In this example, a project leader initiates 
a conversation about organizational priorities with stakeholders, team members, and senior management. Those 
priorities are then recorded as positions on a sliding scale between two extremes. The results are then used to find agile 
techniques that best fit with those priorities.
Figure 6-2. Example of Assessing Organizational Culture
Several models exist for assessing such dynamics; however, the model or method used is not that important. It is 
more critical that project leaders invest the effort to understand the forces that shape their context. Understanding 
the organization and the industry requirements that an organization needs to satisfy allows for choosing the right 
conversations, the right tradeoffs, and, especially, the right techniques.

6.3 Procurement and Contracts
As mentioned earlier in this practice guide, the Agile Manifesto values “customer collaboration over contract 
negotiation.” Many project failures stem from breakdowns in the customer–supplier relationship. Projects incur more 
risk when those involved in the contract take the perspective of winners vs. losers. A collaborative approach is one that 
pursues a shared-risk-reward relationship, where all sides win. Some contracting techniques that can formalize this 
dynamic include the following:
u
u Multi-tiered structure. Rather than formalizing an entire contracting relationship in a single document, project 
parties can achieve more flexibility by describing different aspects in different documents. Mostly fixed items 
(e.g., warranties, arbitration) can be locked in a master agreement. Meanwhile, all parties list other items subject 
to change (e.g., services rates, product descriptions) in a schedule of services. The contract can reference them 
in the master services agreement. Finally, more dynamic items such as scope, schedule, and budget can be 
formalized in a lightweight statement of work. Isolating the more changing elements of a contract into a single 
document simplifies modifications and thus flexibility.
u
u Emphasize value delivered. Many vendor relationships are governed by fixed milestones or “phase gates” 
focused on intermediate artifacts, rather than a full deliverable of incremental business value. Often, these 
controls limit the use of feedback to improve the product. Instead, milestones and payment terms can be 
structured based on value-driven deliverables in order to enhance the project’s agility.
u
u Fixed-price increments. Rather than lock an entire project scope and budget into a single agreement, a project 
can decompose the scope into fixed-price microdeliverables, such as user stories. For the customer, this gives 
more control over how the money is spent. For the supplier, it limits the financial risk of over-commitment to a 
single feature or deliverable.
TIP
Culture versus Structure
Some people insist new organizational structures be installed before any cultural shift can begin. 
Others maintain the opposite—those new organizational structures are only superficial adjustments until 
the collective culture moves in a meaningful direction. In reality, one cannot progress without the other. 
Project leaders wanting to achieve agility should consider the current and future states of both of these 
aspects in their organization.

Section 6 
u
u Not-to-exceed time and materials. Customers incur unwanted risk from a traditional time and materials 
approach. One alternative is to limit the overall budget to a fixed amount. This allows the customer to incorporate 
new ideas and innovations into the project not originally planned. When customers want to incorporate new 
ideas, they will have to manage to a given capacity, replacing original work with new work. Work should be 
closely monitored as hours allocated reach their limit. Also, additional contingency hours could be planned into 
the maximum budget if considered helpful.
u
u Graduated time and materials. Another alternative is a shared financial risk approach. In agile, the quality criteria 
are part of what done means. Therefore, the supplier can be rewarded with a higher hourly rate when delivery is 
earlier than the contracted deadline. Conversely, the supplier would suffer a rate reduction for late delivery.
u
u Early cancellation option. When an agile supplier delivers sufficient value with only half of the scope completed, 
the customer should not be bound to pay the remaining half if the customer no longer needs it. Instead, a contract 
can offer the customer to buy the remainder of the project for a cancellation fee. The customer limits budget 
exposure and the supplier earns positive revenue for services no longer required.
u
u Dynamic scope option. For those contracts with a fixed budget, a supplier may offer the customer the option 
to vary the project scope at specified points in the project. The customer can adjust features to fit the capacity. 
Then the customer can leverage innovation opportunities, while limiting the supplier’s risk of over commitment.
u
u Team augmentation. Arguably the most collaborative contracting approach is to embed the supplier’s services 
directly into the customer organization. Funding teams instead of a specific scope preserves the customer’s 
strategic discretion on what work should actually be done.

79
u
u Favor full-service suppliers. In order to diversify risk, customers may seek a multisupplier strategy. However, 
the temptation will be to contract the work such that each supplier does only one thing, which creates a web of 
dependencies before any usable service or product emerges. Instead, place an emphasis on engagements that 
deliver full value (as in the idea of completed independent feature sets).
It is possible to create agile contracts. Agile is built on a synergy of collaboration and trust. The supplier can help by 
delivering value early and often. The customer can help by providing timely feedback.
6.4 Business Practices
The willingness and ability to create new competences within an organization when the need arises is a mark of 
organizational agility. These do not have to be earth-shattering changes and could be less disruptive in an organization 
that is focused on agility and the results it provides. Transparency and open collaboration are absolutely key.
As cross-functional teams deliver value, the teams and individuals might encounter problems with various support 
functions in the organization.
As team delivers value on a regular basis, finance departments may have the opportunity to capitalize the product 
differently. If the team has contracts with other organizations, procurement departments may need to change those 
contracts to help the other organizations deliver value frequently and synchronize with the team.
Once teams start to work in a cohesive and cooperative manner, they will challenge internal management policies. 
Human resources may notice individual incentives make less sense, and managers may struggle with the performance 
appraisals of self-organizing employees. In each case, these are opportunities to review the degree to which existing 
practices support agile ways of working.
As organizations progress to greater agility, there will be obvious needs for additional business units to change the 
way they interact and perform their responsibilities. The changes that have benefited other areas of the organization 
should now be embraced so the effectiveness of the entire organization can be realized.

Section 6 
6.5 Multiteam Coordination and Dependencies (Scaling)
Many projects incur dependencies, even when they are not managed within a given program. For this reason, it is 
necessary to have an understanding of how agile works within an existing program and portfolio management context.
6.5.1 Frameworks
The guidance of the most widespread agile methods such as Scrum and eXtreme Programming focus on the activities 
of a single, small, usually colocated, cross-functional team. While this is very useful for efforts that require a single 
team, it may provide insufficient guidance for initiatives that require the collaboration of multiple agile teams in a 
program or portfolio.
A range of frameworks (such as the Scaled Agile Framework, Large Scale Scrum, and Disciplined Agile) and approaches 
(e.g., Scrum of Scrums) have emerged to cater to just such circumstances. More details on these can be found in Annex A3.
6.5.2 Considerations
There is more than one way to scale work. The team might need to scale the work of several agile projects into a 
single agile program. Alternatively, the organization can design a structure that supports agile approaches across the 
entire portfolio.
For example, it is helpful to start small and learn as rapidly as possible what works well in the organizational context. 
Teams can achieve successful outcomes even when everything is not completely transformed into an agile approach.
Regardless of the approach, a critical success factor is the healthy agile team. If using an agile approach for a single 
team is not successful, do not try to scale up to using it more broadly; instead, address the organizational impediments 
that prevent teams from working in an agile way.
The goal of large-scale agile projects is to coordinate the efforts of different teams to bring value to customers. There 
is more than one way to do that. Teams may use a formal framework or apply agile thinking to adjust existing program 
management practices.

6.6 Agile and the Project Management Office (PMO)
The PMO exists to shepherd business value throughout the organization. It might do this by helping projects achieve 
their goals. Sometimes, the PMO educates teams (or arranges for training) and supports projects. Sometimes, the PMO 
advises management about the relative business value for a given project or set of projects.
Because agile creates cultural change, over time, the organization might need to change, including the PMO. For 
example, managers make decisions about which projects to fund and when, and teams decide what they need for 
training or advice.
6.6.1 An Agile PMO is Value-Driven
Any project should deliver the right value, to the right audience, at the right time. The PMO’s objective is to facilitate 
and enable this goal. An agile-based PMO approach is based on a customer-collaboration mindset and is present in 
all PMO programs. In many cases, this means the PMO operates as if it were a consulting business, tailoring its efforts 
to meet specific needs requested by a given project. Some projects may need tools and templates, while others may 
benefit from executive coaching. The PMO should strive to deliver what is needed and keep the pulse on its customers 
to ensure that it knows and is able to adapt to their needs. This intrapreneur approach focuses on the PMO activities 
that are perceived as the most valuable to the projects it supports.
6.6.2 An Agile PMO is Invitation-Oriented
In order to accelerate progress on a value-based charter, a PMO may be tempted to mandate certain solutions or 
approaches, for example, to make everyone do it the same way to get some quick wins. However, a more deliberate 
perspective incorporates the desire for employee engagement. This is achieved by inviting only those interested to 
engage with PMO services. Higher engagement with PMO practices makes it easier for those practices to be “sticky.” 
If the PMO is delivering value to its clients, it is more likely that clients will request its services and adopt its practices.

Section 6 
6.6.3 An Agile PMO is Multidisciplinary
In order to support project-specific needs, the PMO needs to be conversant in several competencies beyond 
project management itself, because different projects require distinct capabilities. For instance, one project may need 
organizational design to address staffing challenges while another may require organizational change management 
techniques for stakeholder engagement or unique business models to support customer goals.
Some organizations have been transforming their PMOs into agile centers of excellence that provide such services as:
u
u Developing and implementing standards. Provide templates for user stories, test cases, cumulative flow 
diagrams, etc. Provide agile tools and educate supporting groups on iterative development concepts.
u
u Developing personnel through training and mentoring. Coordinate agile training courses, coaches, and 
mentors to help people transition to an agile mindset and upgrade their skills. Encourage and support people to 
attend local agile events.
u
u Multiproject management. Coordinate between agile teams by communicating between projects. Consider 
sharing items such as progress, issues, and retrospective findings and improvement experiments. Help 
manage major customer releases at the program level and investment themes at the portfolio level using an 
appropriate framework.
u
u Facilitating organizational learning. Gather project velocity profiles and capture, store, and index 
retrospective findings.
u
u Managing stakeholders. Provide product owner training, guidance on acceptance testing, and how to evaluate 
and give feedback on systems. Champion the importance of subject matter experts (SMEs) to projects.
u
u Recruiting, selecting, and evaluating team leaders. Develop guidelines for interviewing agile practitioners.
u
u Executing specialized tasks for projects. Train and provide retrospective facilitators, create agreements with 
agile project troubleshooters, and provide mentors and coaches.

6.7 Organizational Structure
The structure of an organization strongly influences its ability to pivot to new information or shifting market needs. 
Here is a listing of key characteristics:
u
u Geography. Geographically distributed and dispersed project organizations may find several challenges impeding 
their work on any project. Project leaders and regional managers may have alternative or even competing goals. 
Additionally, cultural differences, language barriers, and lower visibility can slow down productivity. Fortunately, 
the use of agile approaches can encourage more collaboration and confidence than would otherwise exist. 
Project leaders in these contexts should encourage dialog at the team and executive level to tailor techniques for 
the context and to manage expectations about the effort required to do so.
u
u Functionalized structures. Some organizations are structured on a spectrum ranging from highly projectized 
to matrixed to highly functionalized. Projects with highly functionalized structures may find general resistance to 
collaboration across its organization.
u
u Size of project deliverable. Reducing the size of a project deliverable will motivate more frequent handoffs 
across departments, and thus more frequent interactions and a faster flow of value across the organization.
u
u Allocation of people to projects. Another approach is to ask for a single person from each department to be 
temporarily, yet fully allocated, to the highest priority project.
u
u Procurement-heavy organizations. Some organizations choose to implement projects primarily through 
vendors. Although project goals may be clear, vendors have a responsibility to look after their own financial 
viability. Moreover, once vendors complete their obligations and leave the engagement, the associated project 
knowledge goes with them. This limits the internal competencies needed for sustained flexibility and speed. Agile 
techniques such as retrospectives and follow up on possible improvement areas when the vendor is still engaged 
can help mitigate loss of product knowledge.

Section 6 
6.8 Evolving the Organization
When addressing an individual challenge area or implementing a new hybrid or agile approach, it is recommended 
to undertake the work incrementally. A common practice is to treat the change process as an agile project with its 
own backlog of changes that could be introduced and prioritized by the team, based on perceived value or other 
considerations. Each of the changes can be treated as an experiment, which is tested for a short period of time to 
determine suitability as-is or the need for further refinement/consideration.
Use kanban boards to track progress, showing the new approaches already in use as “done,” those being tried as “in 
progress,” and those still waiting to be introduced as “to do.” See Figure 6-3 for the initial board with a ranked backlog. 
Figure 6-4 shows an example of what a board might have as work progresses.

A CALL TO ACTION
The adoption of agile and its approaches for managing projects has increased dramatically since the Agile Manifesto 
was first published in 2001. Adoption and the desire to operate with an agile mindset is no longer limited to a certain sized 
organization or those specializing only in information technology. The mindset applies universally and the approaches 
are successful in many settings.
Today, the demand for “being agile” is higher than ever. The debate over the best path to agility continues to keep 
the conversation and innovation evolving. One truth remains constant—inspection, adaptation, and transparency are 
critical to successfully delivering value.
You may not see everything you expected to see in this practice guide. Our core team realizes you may disagree with 
some elements or approaches we did choose to present—and passionately so. We call on your passion to continue 
the conversation and improve the next iteration of this practice guide. This is your journey—learn, experiment, gain 
feedback, and experiment again. Then help us retrospect; give us feedback on the guidance and contribute to future 
editions of this practice guide. After all, inspection without adaptation is wasted effort.
Lastly, we want to encourage you to be engaged in the broader communities of project management and agile to 
further conversations on these topics. Look for representatives from both PMI and Agile Alliance® at conferences and 
meetings and engage them in discussion. Use social media and blog your thoughts and opinions.
You can provide feedback and engage in conversation regarding the contents of this practice guide at the blog called 
“Agile in Practice” at https://www.projectmanagement.com/blogs/347350/Agile-in-Practice.

Section 4
Project Integration Management
Section 5
Project Scope Management
Iterative and agile approaches promote the engagement of team 
members as local domain experts in integration management. 
The team members determine how plans and components 
should integrate.
The expectations of the project manager as noted in the Key 
Concepts for Integration Management sections in the PMBOK® 
Guide do not change in an adaptive environment, but control of 
the detailed product planning and delivery is delegated to the 
team. The project manager’s focus is on building a collaborative 
decision-making environment and ensuring the team has the 
ability to respond to changes. This collaborative approach can 
be further enhanced when team members possess a broad skill 
base rather than a narrow specialization.
In projects with evolving requirements, high risk, or signiﬁcant 
uncertainty, the scope is often not understood at the beginning 
of the project or it evolves during the project. Agile methods 
deliberately spend less time trying to deﬁne and agree on scope 
in the early stage of the project and spend more time 
establishing the process for its ongoing discovery and 
reﬁnement. Many environments with emerging requirements ﬁnd 
that there is often a gap between the real business requirements 
and the business requirements that were originally stated. 
Therefore, agile methods purposefully build and review 
prototypes and release versions in order to reﬁne the 
requirements. As a result, scope is deﬁned and redeﬁned 
throughout the project. In agile approaches, the requirements 
constitute the backlog.

Section 6
Project Schedule Management
Section 7
Project Cost Management
Adaptive approaches use short cycles to undertake work, review 
the results, and adapt as necessary. These cycles provide rapid 
feedback on the approaches and suitability of deliverables, and 
generally manifest as iterative scheduling and on-demand, 
pull-based scheduling, as discussed in the Key Trends and 
Emerging Practices section for Project Schedule Management in 
the PMBOK® Guide.
In large organizations, there may be a mixture of small projects 
and large initiatives requiring long-term roadmaps to manage the 
development of these programs using scaling factors (e.g., team 
size, geographical distribution, regulatory compliance, 
organizational complexity, and technical complexity). To address 
the full delivery life cycle for larger, enterprise-wide systems, 
a range of techniques utilizing a predictive approach, adaptive 
approach, or a hybrid of both, may need to be adopted. The 
organization may need to combine practices from several core 
methods, or adopt a method that has already done so, and adopt 
a few principles and practices of more traditional techniques.
The role of the project manager does not change based on 
managing projects using a predictive development life cycle or 
managing projects in adaptive environments. However, to be 
successful in using adaptive approaches, the project manager will 
need to be familiar with the tools and techniques to understand 
how to apply them effectively.
Projects with high degrees of uncertainty or those where the 
scope is not yet fully deﬁned may not beneﬁt from detailed cost 
calculations due to frequent changes. Instead, lightweight 
estimation methods can be used to generate a fast, high-level 
forecast of project labor costs, which can then be easily adjusted 
as changes arise. Detailed estimates are reserved for short-term 
planning horizons in a just-in-time fashion.
In cases where high-variability projects are also subject to strict 
budgets, the scope and schedule are more often adjusted to stay 
within cost constraints.

Section 8
Project Quality Management
Section 9
Project Resource Management
In order to navigate changes, agile methods call for frequent 
quality and review steps built in throughout the project rather 
than toward the end of the project.
Recurring retrospectives regularly check on the effectiveness of 
the quality processes. They look for the root cause of issues then 
suggest trials of new approaches to improve quality. Subsequent 
retrospectives evaluate any trial processes to determine if they 
are working and should be continued or new adjusting or should 
be dropped from use.
In order to facilitate frequent, incremental delivery, agile methods 
focus on small batches of work, incorporating as many elements 
of project deliverables as possible. Small batch systems aim to 
uncover inconsistencies and quality issues earlier in the project 
life cycle when the overall costs of change are lower.
Projects with high variability beneﬁt from team structures that 
maximize focus and collaboration, such as self-organizing teams 
with generalizing specialists.
Collaboration is intended to boost productivity and facilitate 
innovative problem solving. Collaborative teams may facilitate 
accelerated integration of distinct work activities, improve 
communication, increase knowledge sharing, and provide 
ﬂexibility of work assignments in addition to other advantages.
Although the beneﬁts of collaboration also apply to other project 
environments, collaborative teams are often critical to the 
success of projects with a high degree of variability and rapid 
changes, because there is less time for centralized tasking and 
decision making.
Planning for physical and human resources is much less 
predictable in projects with high variability. In these environments, 
agreements for fast supply and lean methods are critical to 
controlling costs and achieving the schedule.

Section 10
Project Communications Management
Section 11
Project Risk Management
Project environments subject to various elements of ambiguity 
and change have an inherent need to communicate evolving and 
emerging details more frequently and quickly. This motivates 
streamlining team member access to information, frequent team 
checkpoints, and colocating team members as much as possible.
In addition, posting project artifacts in a transparent fashion, 
and holding regular stakeholder reviews are intended to promote 
communication with management and stakeholders.
High-variability environments, by deﬁnition, incur more 
uncertainty and risk. To address this, projects managed using 
adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of 
incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to 
accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood 
and managed. Risk is considered when selecting the content of 
each iteration, and risks will also be identiﬁed, analyzed, and 
managed during each iteration.
Additionally, the requirements are kept as a living document 
that is updated regularly, and work may be reprioritized as the 
project progresses, based on an improved understanding of 
current risk exposure.

Project Procurement Management
Section 13
Project Stakeholder Management
In agile environments, speciﬁc sellers may be used to extend the 
team. This collaborative working relationship can lead to a 
shared risk procurement model where both the buyer and the 
seller share in the risk and rewards associated with a project.
Larger projects may use an adaptive approach for some 
deliverables and a more stable approach for other parts. In these 
cases, a governing agreement such as a master services 
agreement (MSA) may be used for the overall engagement, with 
the adaptive work being placed in an appendix or supplement. 
This allows changes to occur on the adaptive scope without 
impacting the overall contract.
Projects experiencing a high degree of change require active 
engagement and participation with project stakeholders. To 
facilitate timely, productive discussion and decision making, 
adaptive teams engage with stakeholders directly rather than 
going through layers of management. Often the client, user, and 
developer exchange information in a dynamic co-creative 
process that leads to more stakeholder involvement and higher 
satisfaction. Regular interactions with the stakeholder community 
throughout the project mitigate risk, build trust, and support 
adjustments earlier in the project cycle, thus reducing costs and 
increasing the likelihood of success for the project.
In order to accelerate the sharing of information within and 
across the organization, agile methods promote aggressive 
transparency. The intent of inviting any stakeholders to project 
meetings and reviews or posting project artifacts in public 
spaces is to surface as quickly as possible any misalignment, 
dependency, or other issue related to the changing project.

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer 
through early and continuous delivery of 
valuable software.
Welcome changing requirements, even late 
in development. Agile processes harness 
change for the customer’s competitive 
advantage.
Deliver working software frequently, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with 
a preference to the shorter timescale.
Business people and developers must work 
together daily throughout the project.
Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they 
need, and trust them to get the job done.
The most efficient and effective method
of conveying information to and within a 
development team is face-to-face 
conversation.
Working software is the primary measure of 
progress.
Agile processes promote sustainable 
development. The sponsors, developers, and 
users should be able to maintain a constant 
pace indefinitely.
Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility.
Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount 
of work not done is essential.
The best architectures, requirements, and 
designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and 
adjusts its behavior accordingly.

ANNEX A3 
OVERVIEW OF AGILE AND LEAN FRAMEWORKS
This annex describes some of the commonly used agile approaches. These approaches can be used as is or combined 
to adapt to what works best for a given environment or situation. It is not necessary to use any of these; an agile approach 
can be developed from scratch as long as it adheres to the mindset, values, and principles of the Agile Manifesto. If the 
agile principles are followed to deliver value at a sustainable pace, and the developed approach promotes collaboration 
with the customer, a specific approach is not required. A link to more information regarding each approach can be found 
in the Bibliography section of this guide.
A3.1 Selection Criteria for the Agile Practice Guide
There are too many agile approaches and techniques to be explicitly included in this practice guide. Figure A3-1 
depicts a sample of agile approaches based on their depth of guidance and breadth of their life cycles. The specific 
approaches selected for discussion are popular examples that are:
u
u Designed for holistic use. Some agile approaches are centered on a single project activity, such as estimation 
or reflecting. The listed examples include only the more holistic agile frameworks. Some are more full-featured 
than others, but all of the selected approaches are those intended to guide a broad set of project activities.
u
u Formalized for common use. Some agile frameworks are proprietary in nature and designed for specific use by 
a single organization or within a single context. The frameworks described in Sections A3.2 through A3.14 focus 
on those intended for common use in a variety of contexts.
u
u Popular in modern use. Some agile frameworks are holistically designed and well formalized, but are simply not 
commonly being used in most projects or organizations. The agile frameworks described in this annex have been 
adopted by a significant number of industries, as measured by a collection of recent industry surveys.

A3.2 Scrum
Scrum is a single-team process framework used to manage product development. The framework consists of Scrum 
roles, events, artifacts, and rules, and uses an iterative approach to deliver working product. Scrum is run on timeboxes 
of 1 month or less with consistent durations called sprints where a potentially releasable increment of product is 
produced. Table A3-1 lists Scrum events and artifacts utilized for project execution.
The Scrum team consists of a product owner, development team, and scrum master.
u
u The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product.
u
u The development team is a cross-functional, self-organizing team consisting of team members who have 
everything they need within the team to deliver working product without depending on others outside of the team.
u
u The scrum master is responsible for ensuring the Scrum process is upheld and works to ensure the Scrum team 
adheres to the practices and rules as well as coaches the team on removing impediments.

A3.3 eXtreme Programming
eXtreme Programming (XP) is a software development method based on frequent cycles. The name is based on 
the philosophy of distilling a given best practice to its purest, simplest form, and applying that practice continuously 
throughout the project.
XP is most known for popularizing a holistic set of practices intended to improve the results of software projects. 
The method was first formalized as a set of twelve primary practices, but then gradually evolved to adopt several other 
corollary practices. These are listed in Table A3-2.
Table A3-2. The Practices of eXtreme Programming
This evolution was the result of designing and adopting techniques through the filter of core values 
(communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, respect), and informed by key principles (humanity, economics, 
mutual benefit, self-similarity, improvement, diversity, reflection, flow, opportunity, redundancy, failure, quality, 
baby steps, accepted responsibility).

A3.4 Kanban Method
Kanban in lean manufacturing is a system for scheduling inventory control and replenishment. This process of “just-
in-time” inventory replenishment was originally seen in grocery stores when shelves were restocked based on the gaps 
in the shelves and not supplier inventory. Inspired by these just-in-time inventory systems, Taiichi Ohno developed 
Kanban and it was applied at the main Toyota manufacturing facility in 1953.
The word kanban is literally translated as “visual sign” or “card.” Physical kanban boards with cards enable and 
promote the visualization and flow of the work through the system for everyone to see. This information radiator (large 
display) is made up of columns that represent the states the work needs to flow through in order to get to done. The 
simplest of boards could have three columns (i.e., to do, doing, and done), but it is adaptable to whatever states are 
deemed needed by the team utilizing it.
The Kanban Method is utilized and applicable in many settings and allows for a continuous flow of work and value 
to the customer. The Kanban Method is less prescriptive than some agile approaches and thus less disruptive to begin 
implementing as it is the original “start where you are” method. Organizations can begin applying Kanban Methods with 
relative ease and progress toward fully implementing the method if that is what they deem necessary or appropriate.
Unlike most agile approaches, the Kanban Method does not prescribe the use of timeboxed iterations. Iterations 
can be used within the Kanban Method, but the principle of pulling single items through the process continuously and 
limiting work in progress to optimize flow should always remain intact. The Kanban Method may be best used when a 
team or organization is in need of the following conditions:
u
u Flexibility. Teams are typically not bound by timeboxes and will work on the highest priority item in the backlog 
of work.
u
u Focus on continuous delivery. Teams are focused on flowing work through the system to completion and not 
beginning new work until work in progress is completed.
u
u Increased productivity and quality. Productivity and quality are increased by limiting work in progress.

Annex A3
u
u Increased efficiency. Checking each task for value adding or non-value-added activities and removing the non-
value adding activities.
u
u Team member focus. Limited work in progress allows the team to focus on the current work.
u
u Variability in the workload. When there is unpredictability in the way that work arrives, and it becomes 
impossible for teams to make predictable commitments; even for short periods of time.
u
u Reduction of waste. Transparency makes waste visible so it can be removed.
The Kanban Method is derived from lean thinking principles. The defining principles and the core properties of the 
Kanban Method are listed in Table A3-3.
The Kanban Method is a holistic framework for incremental, evolutionary process and systems change for 
organizations. The method uses a “pull system” to move the work through the process. When the team completes an 
item, the team can pull an item into that step.

Kanban boards, such as the one shown in Figure A3-2, are a low-tech, high-touch technology that may seem overly 
simplistic at first, but those using them soon realize their power. Utilizing policies for entry and exit to columns, as well 
as constraints such as limiting work in process, kanban boards provide clear insight to workflow, bottlenecks, blockers, 
and overall status. Additionally the board acts as an information radiator to anyone who sees it, providing up-to-date 
information on the status of the work of the team.
Figure A3-2. Kanban Board Demonstrating Work in Progress Limits, and a Pull System to Optimize the Flow of Work
In the Kanban Method, it is more important to complete work than it is to start new work. There is no value derived 
from work that is not completed so the team works together to implement and adhere to the work in progress (WIP) 
limits and get each piece of work through the system to “done.”

Crystal Methodology realizes that each project may require a slightly tailored set of policies, practices, and processes 
in order to meet the project’s unique characteristics. The family of methodologies use different colors based on “weight” 
to determine which methodology to use. The use of the word crystal comes from the gemstone where the various 
“faces” represent underlying core principles and values. The faces are a representation of techniques, tools, standards, 
and roles listed in Table A3-4.

A3.6 Scrumban
Scrumban is an agile approach originally designed as a way to transition from Scrum to Kanban. As additional agile 
frameworks and methodologies emerged, it became an evolving hybrid framework in and of itself where teams use 
Scrum as a framework and Kanban for process improvement.
In Scrumban, the work is organized into small “sprints” and leverages the use of kanban boards to visualize and 
monitor the work. The stories are placed on the kanban board and the team manages its work by using work-in-
progress limits. Daily meetings are held to maintain the collaboration between the team and to remove impediments. 
A planning trigger is set in place for the team to know when to plan next, typically when the work-in-progress level is 
lower than a predetermined limit. There are no predefined roles in Scrumban—the team retains their current roles.
A3.7 Feature-Driven Development
Feature-Driven Development (FDD) was developed to meet the specific needs of a large software development 
project. Features relate to a small business value capability.
There are six primary roles on a Feature-Driven Development project where individuals can take on one or more of 
the following roles:
u
u Project manager,
u
u Chief architect,
u
u Development manager,
u
u Chief programmer,
u
u Class owner, and/or
u
u Domain expert.

A Feature-Driven Development project is organized around five processes or activities, which are performed iteratively:
u
u Develop an overall model,
u
u Build a features list,
u
u Plan by feature,
u
u Design by feature, and
u
u Build by features.
The life cycle flow and interaction of these five processes is illustrated in Figure A3-4.
Feature-Driven Development activities are supported by a core set of software engineering best practices:
u
u Domain object modeling,
u
u Developing by feature,
u
u Individual class ownership,
u
u Feature teams,
u
u Inspections,
u
u Configuration management,
u
u Regular builds, and
u
u Visibility of progress and results.

A3.8 Dynamic Systems Development Method
Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) is an agile project delivery framework initially designed to add more 
rigor to existing iterative methods popular in the 1990s. It was developed as a noncommercial collaboration among 
industry leaders.
DSDM is known best for its emphasis on constraint-driven delivery. The framework will set cost, quality, and time at 
the outset, and then use formalized prioritization of scope to meet those constraints as shown in Figure A3-5.
Figure A3-5. DSDM Approach to Constraint-Driven Agility
Eight principles guide the use of the DSDM framework:
u
u Focus on the business need.
u
u Deliver on time.
u
u Collaborate.
u
u Never compromise quality.
u
u Build incrementally from firm foundations.
u
u Develop iteratively.
u
u Communicate continuously and clearly.
u
u Demonstrate control (use appropriate techniques).

A3.9 Agile Unified Process
The Agile Unified Process (AgileUP) is an offshoot of the Unified Process (UP) for software projects. It features more 
accelerated cycles and less heavyweight processes than its Unified Process predecessor. The intent is to perform more 
iterative cycles across seven key disciplines, and incorporate the associated feedback before formal delivery. The 
disciplines along with guiding principles are listed in Table A3-5.
Table A3-5. The Key Elements of the Agile Unified Process
A3.10 Scaling Frameworks
A3.10.1 Scrum of Scrums
Scrum of Scrums (SoS), also known as “meta Scrum,” is a technique used when two or more Scrum teams consisting 
of three to nine members each need to coordinate their work instead of one large Scrum team. A representative 
from each team attends a meeting with the other team representative(s), potentially daily but typically two to three 
times a week. The daily meeting is conducted similar to the daily standup in Scrum where the representative reports 
completed work, next set of work, any current impediments, and potential upcoming impediments that might block 
the other team(s). The goal is to ensure the teams are coordinating work and removing impediments to optimize the 
efficiency of all the teams.
Large projects with several teams may result in conducting a Scrum of Scrum of Scrums, which follows the same 
pattern as SoS with a representative from each SoS reporting into a larger group of representatives as shown in 
Figure A3-6.

The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe®) focuses on providing a knowledge base of patterns for scaling development 
work across all levels of the enterprise.
SAFe® is focused on the following principles:
u
u Take an economic view.
u
u Apply systems thinking.
u
u Assume variability; preserve options.
u
u Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles.
u
u Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems.

u
u Visualize and limit work in progress, reduce batch sizes, and manage queue lengths.
u
u Apply cadence; synchronize with cross-domain planning.
u
u Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers.
u
u Decentralize decision making.
SAFe® focuses on detailing practices, roles, and activities at the portfolio, program, and team levels with an emphasis 
on organizing the enterprise around value streams that focus on providing continuous value to the customer.
A3.12 Large Scale Scrum (LeSS)
Large Scale Scrum (LeSS) is a framework for organizing several development teams toward a common goal extending 
the Scrum method shown in Figure A3-6. The core organizing principle is to retain as much as possible of the elements 
of the conventional single-team Scrum model. This helps minimize any extensions to the model that might create 
unnecessary confusion or complexity. Table A3-6 shows a comparison of LeSS and Scrum.
Table A3-6. Comparison of LeSS and Scrum
In order to extend Scrum without losing its essence, LeSS promotes the use of certain discerning principles, such as 
systems thinking, whole product focus, transparency, and others.

A3.13 Enterprise Scrum
Enterprise Scrum is a framework designed to apply the Scrum method on a more holistic organizational level rather 
than a single product development effort. Specifically, the framework advises organization leaders to:
u
u Extend the use of Scrum across all aspects of the organization;
u
u Generalize the Scrum techniques to apply easily at those various aspects; and
u
u Scale the Scrum method with supplemental techniques as necessary.
The intent is to use agile approaches beyond project execution by enabling disruptive innovation.
A3.14 Disciplined Agile (DA)
Disciplined Agile (DA) is a process decision framework that integrates several agile best practices into a comprehensive 
model. DA was designed to offer a balance between those popular methods deemed to be either too narrow in focus 
(e.g., Scrum) or too prescriptive in detail (e.g., AgileUP). To achieve that balance, it blends various agile techniques 
according to the following principles:
u
u People-first. Enumerating roles and organization elements at various levels.
u
u Learning-oriented. Encouraging collaborative improvement.
u
u Full delivery life cycle. Promoting several fit-for-purpose life cycles.
u
u Goal-driven. Tailoring processes to achieve specific outcomes.
u
u Enterprise awareness. Offering guidance on cross-departmental governance.
u
u Scalable. Covering multiple dimensions of program complexity.

APPENDIX X2 
ATTRIBUTES THAT INFLUENCE TAILORING
X2.1 Introduction
This appendix provides high-level guidance on when and how to tailor 
agile approaches. It can be used to determine circumstances that might 
warrant changing or introducing new techniques, and then offers some 
recommendations to consider.
X2.2 First Some Cautions
Tailoring is an advanced topic that should be undertaken by experienced 
practitioners who have been successful using agile approaches as originally 
described in multiple environments before they consider tailoring them. In 
other words, gain experience and be successful with one approach before 
attempting to tailor the approach.
A common response when struggling to adopt an agile practice is to 
consider whether to do it or not. A statement like “Retrospectives were 
unpopular so we decided to drop them” illustrates this issue and indicates 
a more fundamental problem on the team that is unlikely to be addressed 
by tailoring the method. The situation will be made worse by omitting the 
retrospective activity that aims to improve the process.
The Shu-Ha-Ri model of skills 
acquisition describes progression 
from obeying the rules (Shu 守, 
means to obey and protect), through 
consciously moving away from the 
rules (Ha 破, means to change or 
digress), and finally through steady 
practice and improvement finding 
an individual path (Ri 離, means to 
separate or leave). We need to start 
and practice at the Shu level before 
we are ready to move to the Ha level 
to tailor the process or the Ri level to 
invent a new custom process.

Appendix X2
Finally, tailoring should be undertaken in collaboration with the teammates or whoever the change is likely to impact. 
People need to be engaged in the thinking and decision-making process about changing processes in order for them to 
commit and buy-in to the changes in order to have a successful transition. Omitting people from tailoring a process is 
likely to result in resistance and resentment to the change, even if it makes good sense technically. Often, experienced 
coaches or leaders can help to engage people effectively.
X2.3 How to Use this Appendix
To benefit from the guidance listed in this appendix, we recommend first successfully using the agile approaches 
as designed. Then review the tailoring guidelines in Table X2-1 that match the situation and read the associated 
recommendations. Next, discuss the change with the people it will impact and agree on a course of action.
As discussed in Section 5, a good way to evaluate a change is try it for an iteration or two first before adopting it 
permanently. Or, consider a flow-based approach to try to deliver several features. Then, reflect with a retrospective 
and reassess.
When people know they can experiment and provide feedback on the experiment, they are more likely to try something 
new. Having tried it for a timeboxed period, the team should review its effectiveness at a retrospective to determine 
whether it should be continued as-is, modified to improve it, or dropped from use.
Finally, successfully adopted, tailored approaches can be institutionalized into the standard processes used for 
projects that share these characteristics. It is also recommended that guidelines from Section 5 be followed that 
describe adopting (or tailoring) new approaches.
X2.4 Tailoring Recommendations
Listed below are some good practices to consider before tailoring an approach.

X2.4.1 Beware of Taking Things Away
Many of the agile practices act as self-supporting pairs. For instance, colocation and frequent business conversations 
allow for lightweight requirements since gaps in understanding can be filled quickly. Likewise, XP’s ruthless testing 
allows for courageous refactoring as one practice supports the other. Removing something without understanding or 
addressing its counterbalanced practice will likely create more problems than it solves.
X2.4.2 Use the Tailoring Guidelines Table
Using Table X2-1, find the circumstances that match a given situation and consider recommendations for tailoring. 
Discuss any changes with those who will be impacted by the change and plan a short trial first, along with an honest 
follow-up review before committing to the change.
Table X2-1. Tailoring Guidelines
Situation
Tailoring Recommendation
Very large project teams
Restructure large projects as multiple smaller projects. Try a technology trial 
project ﬁrst and then an implementation project.
Consider more frequent releases of fewer features each, which allows for the 
creation of smaller project teams.
Consider reducing the team down to its critical core members. Often too many 
people hinder a process, not help it. Reducing a team size can reduce churn as 
well as costs.
Break large teams into multiple smaller teams and use program management to 
synchronize and coordinate.
Use agile and lean program management to organize the larger effort.
Consider a scaled agile or lean framework such as DA, SAFe®, or LeSS. Each 
offers some useful ideas, and each carries implementation risks and process 
weight/cost.

Appendix X2
Table X2-1. Tailoring Guidelines (cont.)
Situation
Tailoring Recommendation
Dispersed teams
Some safety critical products 
may require additional 
documentation and 
conformance checks beyond 
what agile processes suggest 
out-of-the-box
Stable requirements and 
execution process
Teams are in functional 
silos inside functional 
organizations
Many projects have (some) dispersed team members. Tools like instant 
messaging, video conferencing, and electronic team boards help bridge many 
of the communication gaps.
When teams are likely to remain stable, set up face-to-face meetings as soon as 
possible to make future remote conversations more effective. People who have 
met face-to-face are more likely to enter unﬁltered debate because of higher trust.
When conducting meetings with remote participants where there is a loss of 
facial and body-language cues, consider round-robin check-ins to ensure 
participation and check consensus for decisions.
Also, consider the use of iteration-based agile approaches. When team members 
are many time zones apart, consider using whole-project interactions less 
frequently, while encouraging more personal meetings (two or three people 
at a time) more frequently.
Agile approaches can still be used in these environments, but they need to have 
the appropriate additional layers of conformance review, documentation, and 
certiﬁcation that is required by the domain. In that case, documentation could 
be part of what the team delivers along with ﬁnished features. Features may not 
be done until the documentation is completed.
Consider using a hybrid approach (multiple agile approaches) to get the beneﬁts 
of improved collaboration and communication brought by agile with the added 
rigor required by the product environment. Aircraft ﬂight system developers and 
drug companies use agile approaches coupled with their own additional 
processes to leverage the beneﬁts and retain appropriate controls.
Is agile really needed? If uncertainty in requirements is low, low rates of change, 
or minimal execution risk, the full suite of agile approaches may not be needed. 
While any project beneﬁts from increased collaboration and transparency; some 
of the iterative build and review cycles might be overkill.
If build/feedback cycles do not routinely uncover or reﬁne requirements, 
consider extending their durations to minimize the cost impact of review time.
If the project has high rates of change during design and development, but 
rolling it out to customers is a deﬁned and repeatable process, hybrid 
approaches that use the appropriate life cycle model for each project phase 
may make more sense.
Agile is built on the idea of cross-functional teams. Consider asking people to 
create cross-functional teams themselves, without management involvement and 
see what happens.
If the compensation system is organized to recognize and reward functional 
areas, consider changing that ﬁrst. People might not act in the interest of the

Table X2-1. Tailoring Guidelines (cont.)
Situation
Tailoring Recommendation
Transparency can cause fear
 
Many of the team members 
have little technical domain 
knowledge
Lack of executive buy-in 
Agile terms and language do 
not ﬁt the organizational 
culture
Agile creates a culture of transparency: people show and share their work 
throughout development. This sharing of interim deliverables and being open and 
honest about successes, failures, and current state is transparency. Transparency 
requires courage.
Lead by example and demonstrate transparency in decision-making processes 
by using a status board or whiteboard.
Agile approaches encourage and make use of self-directing teams to make local 
decisions about work items, such as task sequencing and which approach to use 
when solving a problem. When the majority of team members are inexperienced, 
consensus-based approaches may lead to problems and rework. So, for these 
teams, additional help “assigning” and “directing” may be necessary until the 
team gains the necessary skills. In other words, do not just declare that agile will 
be used and let an inexperienced team try to ﬁgure everything out because they 
are empowered and self-directing. Consider building centers of competencies 
to help provide guidance and build domain knowledge.
When executive buy-in is missing, teams will encounter a clash between the 
agile mindset and approaches and the more predictive mindset and approaches.
Find common ground, areas for improvement based on the organization’s needs, 
and then use experiments and retrospectives to progress.
Consider education/training for executives. Consider explaining agile in terms of 
lean thinking: short cycles, small batch sizes, frequent reviews, and retrospectives 
with small improvements.
Modify the terms so people will understand and agree to the activities, if not the 
agile language. Be speciﬁc about what each term means.
For example, if the organization ﬁnds the word “game” unprofessional, don’t 
use terms such as “planning game.” Instead, consider using the term “planning 
workshop.”

APPENDIX X3  
AGILE SUITABILITY FILTER TOOLS
X3.1 Introduction
Agile literature contains many agile suitability filter tools to help assess under what circumstances an agile approach 
is appropriate to use. In 1994, the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) developed an Agile Project Suitability 
Questionnaire and an Organizational Suitability Questionnaire to help gauge likely fit and potential problem areas.
The Crystal family of approaches also employed suitability criteria, ranking projects by team size and the criticality 
of the product or service being developed. Crystal recommends that smaller, less critical projects be undertaken with 
lighter controls and simpler approaches. Large, mission or life critical projects were recommended to use more rigor 
and validation.
Since the development of these approaches, there have been many more models created to help determine 
where and when to employ agile approaches. Boehm and Turner adopted some of the elements from DSDM and 
Crystal to develop a popular assessment model to help determine if projects should be undertaken with agile or more 
traditional approaches.
Based on these previous models and expanded to consider the middle ground of hybrid approaches, the following 
model is proposed. It represents a synthesis of several suitability filter attributes to help organizations assess and 
discuss whether projects should be undertaken using predictive, hybrid, or agile approaches.

Appendix X3
X3.2 Overview of the Model
Organizational and project attributes are assessed under three main categories:
u
u Culture. Is there a supportive environment with buy-in for the approach and trust in the team?
u
u Team. Is the team of a suitable size to be successful in adopting agile, do its members have the necessary 
experience and access to business representatives to be successful?
u
u Project. Are there high rates of change? Is incremental delivery possible? How critical is the project?
Questions in each of these categories are answered and the results plotted on a radar chart. Clusters of values 
around the center of the chart indicate a good fit for agile approaches. Results around the outside indicate a predictive 
approach may be more suitable. Values in the middle portion (between agile and predictive) indicate a hybrid approach 
could work well. An example is shown in Figure X3-1.

X3.3 Instructions for Use
X3.3.1 Complete the Questionnaire as a Group
For small projects, this group may simply be the sponsor, technical lead, and a customer. For large projects, this 
may include representatives from the sponsoring group, project execution team, impacted business group(s), project 
governance group(s), and customer community. The idea is that just as no single stakeholder should estimate or plan a 
project because of representing only one viewpoint and having personal bias; so too should no single person assess the 
suitability of an approach since any one person will also have a limited view with a bias.
Instead, the value of the tool is the conversation it encourages with the invested parties of the project. Even if the 
results point to a hybrid approach, but the stakeholders want to proceed with a largely agile or predictive approach, 
follow the stakeholder consensus. This tool is a high-level diagnostic only, the final decision should rest and be supported 
by the people involved.
X3.3.2 Score the Questions from 1 to 10
As a group, discuss and agree (or compromise) on a score that most accurately reflects the subjective evaluation 
of the question. While definitive options are only provided for the start, middle, and end points of the answer spectrum 
representing scores of 1, 5, and 10, it is fine (and desirable) to use scores such as 2 for “almost a 1, but not quite,” 
or 7 for “somewhere between a 5 and a 10.” Again, the assessment is a discussion tool—views will be subjective 
and shades of gray are to be expected.
When the group cannot agree on a score, discuss the issues openly and honestly. Before suggesting compromises 
(i.e., using average scores or marking PMO scores with a blue “X” and the development team with a green “O”), consider 
how successful is the project likely to be when the participants cannot agree on completing a simple assessment? 
When discussing the issues, if the differences of opinion can be identified—then great, it is working; now come to an 
agreement. Likewise, if the assessment indicates a predictive approach but everyone wants to try an agile approach (or 
vice versa) that is fine too, just understand the issues and discuss how the impacts of the approach will be handled.

X3.3.3 Interpret the Results
Mark the answers from the questions on a blank suitability assessment chart and connect the points. Results clustered 
around the center in the agile zone indicate a good fit for a purely agile approach.
Results predominantly in the hybrid zone indicate some combination of agile and predictive approaches might work 
best. However, it is also possible that an agile approach with some additional risk reduction steps such as extra 
education and training or extra validation and documentation rigor in the case of high criticality projects may suffice. 
Alternatively, a predictive approach with some proof-of-concept work or extra processes could also work.
Results predominantly in the predictive zone indicate a good fit for a purely predictive approach. As mentioned in 
Section X3.3.2 (Score the Questions step), this diagnostic tool is aimed at starting meaningful conversations with the 
impacted parties about the most appropriate approach to use. If the approach suggested by the tool is not acceptable it 
is allowed to use a different approach. Use the results as inputs to the risk management process, since the tool indicates 
mismatches that will need to be managed.

X3.5.1 Case Studies
To illustrate how the radar chart works, here are two examples of using the model to score very different types of 
projects. The first is an example of an online drug store project (see Figure X3-12) and the second (Figure X3-13) is 
an example of a military messaging system. These two case studies illustrate some of the variances seen on projects. 
Central clustering indicates a good fit for agile approaches, peripheral scores indicate predictive approaches might be 
more suitable. Some projects are centered around the middle but then spike out on one or two axes. These projects may 
be best solved with a hybrid approach.

X3.5.1.1 Drug Store Example
The project was to develop an online drug store to sell cheaper Canadian prescription drugs to (primarily) U.S. 
customers. The sale of these drugs is a contentious subject in Canada as well as the U.S. and as a result the industry 
is characterized by swift regulation changes and fierce competition. The project faced extremely volatile requirements 
with major changes week on week. It used very short (2-day) iterations and weekly releases to tackle the high rates 
of change.
As shown in Figure X3-12, high levels of buy-in and trust are evident for those who worked in an empowered way. 
The visual nature of the website made it easy to show new increments of functionality, but the system criticality was 
fairly high with essential funds for the pharmacy at stake. As mentioned, there were very high rates of change, but 
the small experienced team handled them well and had easy access to a knowledgeable business representative. The 
approach was very successful and extremely agile.
X3.5.1.2 Military Messaging System Example
Contrast the first example with a large project to develop military messaging system that had already been running 
for 5 years when the assessment was made. See Figure X3-13.

Appendix X3
Buy-in for an agile approach was lacking because an agile approach was not being considered. Trust in the vendors 
was mixed but generally respected. Decision making was not local, but instead made by architecture and requirements 
committees. While elements of the design could be tested incrementally in a laboratory, they could not be gathered 
together for an end to end demonstration of functionality. Many lives were potentially at risk, so criticality was very 
high. Requirements were locked down because changes impacted so many subcontractor organizations.
The project was large with more than 300 people from one vendor alone, but each role had many experienced 
practitioners. Finally, access to the business/customer was not possible, but contract analysts were available to ask 
specification questions to and they usually replied or asked clarifying questions within 10 days. Parts of the project 
could have been carved off and run as agile projects, but at the heart of the initiative was a single large project.
X3.6 Summary
Agile suitability filters are useful tools for identifying potential fits and gaps for agile approaches. They should not be 
used as definitive inclusion or exclusion gates, but instead as topics for objective discussion with all interested parties.

Agile Practice Guide
Originating in the software industry in the early 2000s, the 
agile movement has permeated a broad range of industries. 
Organizations in diverse fields such as manufacturing, 
education and healthcare (among others) are implementing 
agile approaches. Organizations seeking a competitive 
advantage in today’s marketplace value agile as they strive to 
become quicker, more responsive and flexible—all desirable 
organizational traits in a fast-paced, complex environment.
Support exists for both traditional project management and 
agile approaches to achieve successful project outcomes. The 
Project Management Institute (PMI) partnered with Agile 
Alliance® to develop the Agile Practice Guide.
The Agile Practice Guide provides tools, situational guidelines 
and an understanding of the various agile approaches available 
to enable better results. This practice guide is essential for 
anyone who wants to learn more about agile approaches, but 
it is especially useful for those project managers accustomed 
to working in a more traditional environment who want to 
adapt to a more agile approach. It is specifically designed to 
work hand-in-hand with PMI’s flagship publication, A Guide to 
the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – 
Sixth Edition.
Filled with examples, tips and case studies, and created with 
input from the leading experts in the field of agile practices, 
the Agile Practice Guide is an essential tool you can use to lead 
your organization to successful results.
